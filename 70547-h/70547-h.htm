opportunity of acknowledging many acts of courtesy shown by gentlemen who take an
interest in the subject.</p>

<p>They have appreciated the importance of making the collection complete, and
reliable as a <em>book of reference</em> on Parody and Burlesque, and by the information they have
sent, have assisted me to carry out my design so far as it has gone.</p>

<p>In some few cases the difficulty of finding the authors has prevented me from obtaining their
permission to insert their poems, but in every instance due acknowledgment has been made.</p>

<p>No trouble has been spared to obtain every parody worth quoting, to trace every poem to its
original source, and to give the Authors’ names, wherever they could be ascertained.</p>

<p>Without the assistance of the Authors themselves it would have been impossible to collect and
verify such a mass of information, and my thanks are especially due to the following gentlemen,
either for permission to reprint their parodies, or for other literary assistance in the compilation of
the work: E. B. Anstee, Cuthbert Bede, (<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> E. Bradley,) F. W. Crawford, T. F. Dillon-Croker,
J. G. Dalton (of Boston, U.S.) F. B. Doveton, James Gordon, F.S.A., J. H. Ingram, J. Brodie-Innes,
John Lane, <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> H. C. Leonard, J. M. Lowry, A. W. Mackenzie, F. B. Perkins (of San Francisco,
U.S.) Walter Parke, Edward Simpson, G. R. Sims, T. H. Smith, (of Chicago, U.S.) Edward
Walford, M.A., C. H. Waring, and Edmund H. Yates.</p>

<p>Not only has their friendly aid cheered my labors, but it has encouraged me to hope for
equally valuable assistance during the publication of the Sixth Volume, which will deal principally
with the works of living poets, or with the poems of those who have only recently passed away.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the principal poems
written by Thomas Gray, upon most of which
parodies will be given:</p>

<ul>
<li>Elegy written in a Country Church-Yard.</li>
<li>Ode on the Spring.</li>
<li>On the Death of a favourite Cat.</li>
<li>On a distant Prospect of Eton College.</li>
<li>To Adversity.</li>
<li>The Progress of Poesy.</li>
<li>The Bard.</li>
<li>Ode for Music.</li>
<li>The Fatal Sisters.</li>
<li>The Triumphs of Owen.</li>
<li>The Descent of Odin.</li>
<li>The Death of Hoel.</li>
<li>A Long Story.</li>
</ul>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The Elegy in a Country Churchyard was commenced
by Gray in 1742, at the age of 34; it was then laid
aside, to be taken up again after the death of his aunt, Mary
Antrobus, in 1749. Stoke-Poges Churchyard, where this
lady was buried, is the generally accepted scene of the poem,
and there the poet was himself afterwards laid to rest.</p>

<p>The “Elegy” was completed at Stoke in June, 1750, a
copy, in MS., was sent immediately by Gray to his friend
Horace Walpole, and another to Dr. Wharton of Durham,
which latter is now in the library of the British Museum.
Another MS. is in the library of Pembroke College, Cambridge,
but which was really the <em>original</em> MS. cannot be
definitely ascertained, as Gray sent out several other copies
to his friends. Hence the difficulty there is now in deciding
upon the particular version of the “Elegy” which received
the last finishing touches of the author, who was known to
be most fastidious in the diction, and punctuation of his
poems.</p>

<p>On the 12th June, 1750, Gray announced to Walpole that
“a thing,” whose beginning he had seen long before, had
at last got an end to it, “a merit,” he added, “that most
of my writings have wanted and are like to want.” This
“thing” was the “Elegy.” Walpole showed it about,
copies were taken, and early in 1751 Gray received a letter
from the editors of the “Magazine of Magazines” informing
him that his “ingenious poem” was in the press, and
begging not only his indulgence, but the <em>honour</em> of his
correspondence. “I am not at all disposed,” wrote Gray,
“to be either so indulgent or so correspondent as they
desire.” Gray had not intended to publish the poem, but
annoyed at the unscrupulous action of the proprietors of the
“Magazine of Magazines,” he determined to forestall them
if possible, and requested Walpole to get the “Elegy”
printed without the author’s name, “in what form is most
convenient to the printer, but on his best paper and character;
he must correct the press himself, and print it without

any intervals between the stanzas, because the sense is in some
places continued beyond them.” Accordingly, on the 16th
of February, 1751, five days after this letter was written, the
first edition was printed and published by Robert Dodsley of
Pall Mall. In this hasty manner, and without the author’s
corrections, was issued from the press one of the most
popular poems in the English language.</p>

<p>It also appeared in <cite>The Magazine of Magazines</cite> (London)
for February, 1751, where it was introduced as having been
composed “by the very ingenious Mr. <em>Gray</em>, of <em>Peterhouse</em>,
Cambridge.” In this it was entitled, <cite>Stanzas written in a
Country Churchyard</cite>, although it was entered in the Index as
<cite>An Elegy made in a Country Churchyard</cite>. This was more
modern in its orthography, and contained several variations
from the authorised edition published by Dodsley.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt but that this pirated version of
the “Elegy” was at first generally preferred to Gray’s
authorised edition, in which there were some very obvious
errors, due to its hasty production. Certain it is that all
subsequent editions far more nearly resembled the pirated
version, than that printed by Dodsley at Gray’s request.</p>

<p>Dodsley’s first edition was in quarto, and is now excessively
rare. The following is an exact reprint of it, the original
orthography and style of printing being in strict accordance
with the copy now in the library of the British Museum.
The only variation being that the stanzas are numbered for
convenience of reference to the foot notes.</p>

<p>15. Mr. Edwards (author of the Canons of Criticism), who, though
an old bachelor, like Mr. Gray, was far more attentive to the fair
sex, endeavoured to supply what he thought a defect in this Poem,

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Some lovely fair, whose unaffected charms</div>
<div class="i2">Shone with attraction to herself unknown;</div>

<p>18. After this verse, in Mr. Gray’s first <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> of the Poem, were the
four following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<div class="i1">The thoughtless world to Majesty may bow,</div>
<div class="i2">Exalt the brave, and idolize success;</div>

<p>25. In the M.S. copy of the Elegy bequeathed by Gray to his friend
Mason which is now in the possession of Sir William Fraser, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr>,
the last two lines of this stanza read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<div class="i1">On the high brow of yonder hanging lawn.</div>

<p>After this stanza in the same manuscript there was the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Him have we seen the greenwood side along,</div>
<div class="i2">While o’er the heath we hied, our labour’s done,</div>

</div><!--end poem-->

<p>“I rather wonder (says Mr. Mason) that he rejected this stanza, as
it completes the account of his whole day; whereas, this Evening
scene being omitted, we have only his Morning walk, and his Noontide
repose.”</p>

<p>29. Before the Epitaph, Mr. Gray originally inserted a very beautiful
stanza, which was printed in some of the first editions, but
afterwards omitted, because he thought that it was too long a parenthesis
in this place. The lines however are, in themselves, exquisitely
fine, and demand preservation.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the want of originality in some detached
passages of this “Elegy,” and the obvious truisms of many
of its ideas, it is doubtless the finest poem of its kind in the
language, not even excepting the beautiful, and perhaps more
pathetic, “Elegy on the Death of Sir John Moore.” The
best proof of its popularity is to be found in the immense
number of Parodies, Imitations, and Translations to which it
has given rise. In dealing with the Parodies the chief difficulty
has been to decide which were worthy of preservation.
To reprint <em>all</em> the Parodies, in full, is out of the question,
yet the omission of any important or noteworthy example
would destroy the utility of this Collection as a work of
reference, especially in the eyes of the numerous admirers
of Thomas Gray.</p>

<p>To readers not having access to either of our great public
libraries it is the earlier parodies which are the most difficult
to refer to, these will therefore be inserted complete, though
it must be admitted that the first half dozen will be found
rather heavy reading.</p>

<p>These will be followed by selections from the most
amusing modern parodies, and a few of the best imitations
and translations.</p>

<p>The earliest parody I can trace of Gray’s “Elegy” is one
entitled&mdash;</p>

<p>The above is an exact reprint of the very scarce first
edition of this parody, which was brought out by the same
publisher, and within two years, of Gray’s “Elegy.” It
was published in quarto size, and in type and style closely
resembled the original “Elegy.”</p>

<p>“An Evening Contemplation in a College” was written
by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Duncombe, M.A., of Corpus College,
Cambridge, who was born in 1730 and died on January 19,
1786. He was the author of several other poems and
parodies, neither of which obtained the success of the above,
which has been frequently reprinted. It appears at the end
of one Dublin edition of Gray’s Poems, in 12mo, 1768, and
of another printed by William Sleater in 1775. A pirated
quarto edition was published in London by J. Wheble in
1776, and attributed to “An Oxonian,” it was also included
in the collection entitled <cite>The Oxford Sausage</cite>, and in the
second volume of <cite>The Repository</cite>, London, 1777. All these
reprints contain numerous verbal alterations from the original.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The next parody, which bears no date, was probably
published only a little later than the above, as it was issued
in quarto in the same general style, and by the same firm.</p>

<p>Bartholomew (or Bartlemy) Fair, was formerly held in
Smithfield on September 3rd, unless that day fell on a
Sunday. Of later years it became an intolerable nuisance
in the city, the shows were discontinued in 1850, and the
Fair was proclaimed for the last time in 1855. A very
interesting account of the old customs attending it will be
found in Hone’s “Every Day Book.”</p>

<div class="i1">The turnkey rings the bell for shutting out,</div>
<div class="i2">The visitor walks slowly to the gate;</div>
<div class="i1">The debtor chum-ward hastes in idle rout,</div>
<div class="i2">And leaves the Bench to darkness, me, and fate.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now fades the high-spiked wall upon the sight,</div>
<div class="i2">And all the space a silent air assumes!</div>
<div class="i1">Save where some drunkard from the Brace<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_12"

<div class="i2">And drowsy converse lulls the distant rooms.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Save that from yonder Strong Room,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_13"

<div class="i2">Some noisy wight does to the night complain,</div>
<div class="i1">Of Mister Jones, the marshal, who, unkind</div>
<div class="i2">Has, by a week’s confinement, check’d his reign.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Within those strong-built walls, down that parade,</div>
<div class="i2">Where lie the stones all paved in order fair,</div>
<div class="i1">Each in his narrow room by bailiffs laid,</div>
<div class="i2">The new-made pris’ners o’er their caption swear.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The gentle morning bustle of their trade,</div>
<div class="i2">The ’prentice, from the garret overhead,</div>
<div class="i1">The dapper shopman, or the busy maid,</div>
<div class="i2">Will never here arouse them from their bed.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For them no polish’d Rumfords here shall burn,</div>

<div class="i2">Or climb his knees, the sugar-plums to share.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Oft did the creditor to their promise yield,</div>
<div class="i2">As often they that solemn promise broke;</div>
<div class="i1">How jocund did they drive the duns afield!</div>
<div class="i2">’Till nick’d at last within the bailiff’s yoke!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="i1">The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow’r,</div>

<div class="i2">The paths of spendthrifts lead but to the Bench.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault,</div>
<div class="i2">That they are here, and not at large like you,</div>

<div class="i2">Bills that, alas! have long been overdue.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Can story gay, or animated tale,</div>

<div class="i1">Perhaps in this confined retreat is shut</div>
<div class="i2">Some heart, to make a splash once all on fire:</div>
<div class="i1">Skill, that might Hobhouse to the rout have put,</div>
<div class="i2">Or loyally play’d Doctor Southey’s lyre.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But prudence to their eyes her careful page,</div>
<div class="i2">Rich in pounds, shillings, pence, did ne’er unroll.</div>
<div class="i1">Stern creditors repress’d their noble rage,</div>
<div class="i2">And froze the genial current of their soul.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Full many a blood, in fashion an adept,</div>
<div class="i2">The dark, lone rooms of spunging-houses bear</div>
<div class="i1">Full many a fair is born to bloom unkept,</div>
<div class="i2">And waste her sweetness, none know how or where.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Some cockney Petersham, that with whisker’d cheek</div>

<div class="i1">Some humble Mrs. Clarke<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_14"

<div class="i2">Some Burdett, guiltless quite of speaking well.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The applauses of admiring mobs to gain</div>

<div class="i2">And read their triumph in the Morning Post.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pageno">17</span>
<div class="i1">That lot forbade; nor circumscribed alone</div>
<div class="i2">Their growing follies, but themselves confined;</div>
<div class="i1">The bailiff grimly seized them for his own,</div>
<div class="i2">And turnkeys closed the gates on them behind.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,</div>
<div class="i2">To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,</div>
<div class="i1">The King’s Bench terribly pulls down our pride</div>
<div class="i2">For high or lowly born, ’tis all the same.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Far from the city’s mad ignoble strife</div>
<div class="i2">They still retain an eager wish to stray;</div>
<div class="i1">They hate this cool sequester’d mode of life,</div>
<div class="i2">And wish at liberty to work their way.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And on those walls that still from duns protect</div>
<div class="i2">Those fire-proof walls, so strongly built and high,</div>
<div class="i1">With uncouth rhymes and mis-spelt verses deck’d,</div>
<div class="i2">They ask the passing tribute of a sigh.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Their names, their years, writ by th’ unletter’d muse</div>
<div class="i2">The place of fame and brass plate fill up well;</div>
<div class="i1">And many a lawyer’s too the stranger views</div>
<div class="i2">With pious wishes he may go to hell.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,</div>
<div class="i2">His pleasing anxious liberty resign’d,</div>
<div class="i1">To Banco Regis bent his dreary way,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor cast one longing lingering look behind.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">On some one out, the prisoner still relies,</div>
<div class="i2">Some one to yield him comfort, he requires;</div>
<div class="i1">E’en from the Bench the voice of nature cries,</div>
<div class="i2">E’en though imprison’d, glow our wonted fires.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For thee, who, mindful of the debtor’s doom,</div>
<div class="i2">Dost in these lines their hapless state relate;</div>
<div class="i1">If chance by writ or capias hither come,</div>
<div class="i2">Some kindred spirit may inquire thy fate.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Haply, some hoary bailiff here may say,</div>
<div class="i2">“Oft have we watch’d him at the peep of dawn,</div>
<div class="i1">But, damn him, still he slipped from us away,</div>
<div class="i2">And when we thought we had him, he was gone.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Where Drury Lane erects its well-known head,</div>
<div class="i2">And Covent Garden lifts its domes on high,</div>
<div class="i1">Morning and noon and night we found him fled,</div>
<div class="i2">Most snugly poring on us passing by.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“On Sundays, ever smiling as in scorn,</div>
<div class="i2">Passing our houses, he would boldly rove;</div>
<div class="i1">We gave his case up as of one forlorn,</div>
<div class="i2">And for his person pined in hopeless love.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“One morn we track’d him near th’ accustom’d spot</div>
<div class="i2">Along the Strand, and by his favourite she&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Another came; yet still we caught him not,</div>
<div class="i2">But on the third, we nabb’d a youth,&mdash;’twas  he.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“The next, with warrant due, we brought our man,</div>
<div class="i2">Snug to the Bench, here all the way from town,</div>
<div class="i1">Approach and read the warrant (if you can),</div>
<div class="i2">You may a copy get for half-a-crown.”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><span class="sc">The Warrant.</span></div>
<div class="i1">Here rests his head, in “seventeen” and one,</div>
<div class="i2">A youth to fortune and to fame well-known.</div>
<div class="i1">But tradesmen trusted and began to dun,</div>
<div class="i2">And Mister Sheriff marked him for his own.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Great were his spendings, he naught put on shelf,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">To send a recompense law did not fail:</div>
<div class="i1">He gave his cred’tors, all he had&mdash;himself</div>
<div class="i2">He gain’d from them (all he abhorred) a gaol!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">No further seek his doings to disclose,</div>
<div class="i2">Or draw his follies from this dull abode,</div>
<div class="i1">(Here he’ll at all events three months repose),</div>
<div class="i2">Th’ Insolvent Act may open then a road.</div>

<p>This Parody was published anonymously in a little work,
entitled, “<cite>Prison Thoughts</cite>,” by a Collegian. London,
John Lowndes, 1821. It was afterwards reprinted in “<cite>Doings
in London</cite>, or Day and Night Scenes in the Metropolis,” by
George Smeeton, which was published about 1828. In this
it is said that the above Parody of Gray’s Elegy was written
by a favourite dramatist, but it does not give his name.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Another parody, with a somewhat similar title,
was published, in quarto, in 1790, of which the
following is an exact reprint, omitting an advertisement,
a list of subscribers, a dedication to Sir
Martin Stapylton Bart, and some rather tedious
footnotes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="i1">The surly crier rings his nightly knell,</div>

<div class="i1">Within these narrow cells, in durance vile,</div>

<div class="i2">Th’ inglorious captives ev’ry grief sustain.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The breezy call of incense-breathing morn</div>
<div class="i2">Gives not its wonted joy unto their shed,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Here dwells the rustic, who with thoughtless zeal</div>
<div class="i2">The petty <em>tyrant</em> of his fields defied,</div>
<div class="i1">Doom’d, by some lordly Villain’s frown, to feel</div>
<div class="i2">The tedious malice of hard hearted Pride.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Here too, in long captivity remain</div>

<div class="i1">And yet some <em>tutors</em> with a scanty fare</div>

<div class="i1">Then by a cruel false deceiver led,</div>
<div class="i2">Wearied with mis’ry, frantic with despair,</div>

<div class="i1">For thee, who mindful of thy own mischance,</div>

<div class="i1">Around his grave the cypress wreath entwine,</div>

<div class="i1">Great Tom now sounds the close of busy day,</div>

<div class="i1">Now stars terrestrial glimmer through each street,</div>
<div class="i2">Thro’ all the air a din confus’d is spread,</div>
<div class="i1">Save where perchance some list’ning crowd you meet,</div>
<div class="i2">By nightly songsters’ strain discordant led;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Save that from yonder watch-box standing near,</div>
<div class="i2">The old night-guardian tells his wonted tale;</div>
<div class="i1">Or urged by outrage dire to timely fear,</div>
<div class="i2">Makes his loud rattle sound upon the gale.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">On cobbler’s stall, or screen’d by friendly shed,</div>
<div class="i2">Full many a maid once breath’d her nightly woes;</div>

<div class="i2">The houseless wand’rers of the street repose.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The noisy call of Smithfield’s early train,</div>
<div class="i2">The sweep’s shrill matins from the chimney stack,</div>
<div class="i1">The dustman’s bell, or post-boy’s piping strain,</div>
<div class="i2">No more shall call their fleeting spirits back.</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Their lot forbade:&mdash;nor yet did fortune frown,</div>

<div class="i1">“There, in the midway region of the pit,</div>

<div class="i2">An Author, once to wits and patrons known;</div>

<div class="i1">No longer now pil’d up in useless state,</div>

<div class="i1">Perhaps, at last, doom’d by capricious fate</div>
<div class="i2">To kindle pipes, or curl some crazy crown.</div>

<div class="i1">Oft did the grammar to their patience yield,</div>

<div class="i1">But who, to dull law precedents a prey,</div>

<div class="i1">Sound was his judgment and his soul sincere,</div>
<div class="i2">Fortune a recompense did largely send;</div>

<p>This parody originally appeared in a publication
called <cite>Town-Talk</cite>, but was afterwards
reprinted in a scarce little volume of poems
entitled “<cite>Plaintive Tales</cite>,” by a Comedian. Published
by W. Tilley, Chelsea, London, in 1819.
This book is now principally sought after by
collectors because it has an early illustration
by George Cruikshank, on which the name
is incorrectly spelt <em>Cruikshanks</em>.</p>

<p>Cremorne Gardens were closed in 1877.
These gardens had had a long and chequered
career, and the ground they stood on has since
been entirely built over. Elderly people can
remember that fifty years ago a certain Count
de Berenger started an Institution called “<cite>The
Stadium</cite>,” or British National Arena, in the
grounds of Lord Cremorne. Here archery,
riding, swimming, and gymnastics were taught,
but the venture did not succeed. The lighter,
and more frolicsome, entertainments of Cremorne
Gardens were tried instead.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Circuit Elegy.</span> <br />
<cite>By the late Lord Chelmsford.</cite></p>

<p>On the occasion of a dinner given by the Bar Mess to
Lord Justice Bramwell and Mr. Justice Denman, at Maidstone,
on July 12, 1881, Mr. Justice Denman rose and remarked
that amongst some old papers he had found a MS.
by the late Lord Chelmsford, being a parody on Gray’s
‘Elegy;’ he then read it, and afterwards offered it to the
Mess.</p>

<p>Mr. Day, Q.C., moved that it be accepted and entered in
the Minute Book, and that copies should be printed and sent
to the members of the Bar Mess.</p>

<p>The motion was carried unanimously.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">IMITATIONS OF GRAY’S ELEGY.</p>

<p>Imitations of Gray’s “Elegy” are not only
numerous, but are, as a rule, both long and
dull. It is not, therefore, advisable to reprint
them in this collection, but for the sake of
completeness, some of the best must be
enumerated.</p>

<p>William Mason, the poet, and biographer of
Gray, ventured to write an imitation, entitled
“An Elegy in a Churchyard in South Wales.”</p>

<p>Mason said his desire was to describe a <em>day</em>
scene, so as to contrast it with the twilight
scene of Gray’s “Elegy.”</p>

<p>But Mason’s presumption and self-sufficiency
were extreme, not only could he venture to put
forth this mawkish elegy, written in a churchyard
by <em>day</em>, as a companion-piece to the far-famed
<em>twilight</em> scene; but he also had the
effrontery to tack a paltry tail-piece to Gray’s
exquisite fragment on “Vicissitude,” and even
believed himself capable of improving Gray’s
epistolary compositions, although Gray was
known to be one of the most fastidious, and
most correct of writers. Mason’s tampering
with Gray’s letters has been repeatedly exposed,
and his imitations of Gray’s poetry now
rest in merited oblivion. Another author, with
almost equal temerity, ventured to publish a</p>

<p class="center">SUPPLEMENT <br />
to <br />
<span class="sc">Gray’s Elegy in a Church Yard</span>.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The celebrated elegy in a Church Yard, by Gray, is well
known, and justly admired by every one who has the least
pretensions to taste. But with all its polish, and deep
poetic beauty and feeling, it always appeared to me, to be
defective, and I have met with a remark in Cecil’s Remains,
to the same effect. Amid a scene so well calculated
to awaken in a pious mind reflection on the sublime truths
and inspiring hopes of Christianity, Gray, with the exception
of two or three somewhat equivocal expressions,
says scarcely a word which might not have been said by
one who believed that “death was an eternal sleep,” and
who was disposed to regard the humble tenants of these
tombs as indeed “Each in his narrow cell <em>for ever</em> laid.”
With these views I have regretted, that sentiments similar
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pageno">43</span>
to the following had not sprung up in the heart, and received
the exquisite touches of the classic pen of Gray.
They might with great propriety have followed the stanza
beginning, “Far from the madding crowds’ ignoble strife.”</p>

<div class="i1">No airy dreams their simple fancies fired,</div>

<div class="i1">Here they from truth’s eternal fountain drew</div>
<div class="i2">The pure and gladdening waters day by day,</div>

<div class="i1">The mingled tribute of their prayers and praise,</div>

<div class="i1">Here, from those honored lips, which sacred fire</div>
<div class="i2">From Heaven’s high chancery hath touched, they hear</div>
<div class="i1">Truths which their zeal inflame, their hopes inspire,</div>
<div class="i2">Give wings to faith, and check affliction’s tear.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">When life flowed by, and, like an angel, Death</div>
<div class="i2">Came to release them to the world on high,</div>
<div class="i1">Praise trembled still on each expiring breath,</div>
<div class="i2">And holy triumph beamed from every eye.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then gentle hands their “dust to dust” consign;</div>

Torri</em>. Veronese. Livorno Tipografia Migliaresi. 1843.
This contains the original Elegy in English, followed by
twelve Italian translations in different metres, five in
Latin, one in Hebrew, six in French, one in German prose
by William Mason, and three in German verse, or twenty-eight
translations in all, and it mentions others which are not
included. There are also copious notes, and a biography of
Thomas Gray. The press mark in the B. M. Library
of this very curious volume is <strong><span class="larger">1465 K</span></strong>.</p>

<p>In 1839, a Polyglott edition of Gray’s Elegy was published
by Mr. John Van Voorst, of Paternoster Row, London.
This charming little volume contains some of the finest
specimens of modern wood engraving, in which the artists
have admirably succeeded in realising the spirit of the poem.
The text consists of the original poem, with Greek, Latin,
German, French, and Italian translations. The Greek translation
was by Thomas J. Mathias, author of “The Pursuits
of Literature,” the Latin by <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Hildyard, the
Italian by Guiseppe Torelli, and the German by F. G. Gotter.
The French version is ascribed to M. Le Fourneur, whose
verses are of very unequal merit; in a few cases he compresses
the sense of a verse into two lines, in others he
spreads it over six lines, whilst some of Gray’s most poetical
ideas and images are entirely omitted.</p>

<p>The second verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,</div>
<div class="i2">And all the air a solemn stillness holds,</div>
<div class="i1">Save where the Beetle wheels his droning flight,</div>
<div class="i2">And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds.</div>

<p>A scarce little pamphlet published at Chatham in 1806,
(kindly lent by Samuel Timmins, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>,) contains some
imitations of the Elegy which have already appeared in this
Collection, together with an excellent French translation
which is worthy of preservation. The Title page runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Elliot Stock published an illustrated edition of the
Elegy, containing a <em>facsimile</em> of the fair copy of the poem in
Gray’s hand writing, (which is in Pembroke College, Cambridge,)
together with notes of the principle variations in
different copies of the Elegy preserved in other collections.</p>

<p>The following articles also contain information on Gray’s
poems, and more especially concerning the Elegy.</p>

<p><cite>The Quarterly Review</cite>, London, December, 1853.</p>

<p>Walford’s <cite>Antiquarian Magazine and Bibliographer</cite> for
November and December, 1883.</p>

<p>In 1884, Mr. K. L. Munden issued a prospectus of a proposed
work, intended to contain Parallel Poems, Parodies,
and Imitations of Gray’s Elegy. The book was to have been
in quarto, and issued at the price of one guinea, but it does
not appear in the British Museum Catalogue, so it is probable
that it was not published.</p>

<p>In a small publication entitled <cite>Edgbastonia</cite> for November,
1884, there appeared an article on Parodies, and imitations
of Gray’s Elegy, signed by K. L. Munder, probably a misprint
for Munden. This contained very little additional information
to that previously given in the two admirable
articles in Walford’s <cite>Antiquarian Magazine</cite> above named.</p>

<p>A subscriber to this Collection writes that a parody
entitled “<cite>An Elegy written in a London Churchyard</cite>”
appeared in “The Literary Sketch Book,” for 1825, London.
No such work however appears in the catalogue of the British
Museum Library, the parody mentioned cannot therefore be
included.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Dr. Tisdall, of Dublin, has courteously written to point
out a few errors which occurred in his parody, <cite>The Elegy
on Mrs. Mulligan</cite>, as it originally appeared in <cite>The Elocutionist</cite>,
as well as in the reprint of it on <a href="#Mulligan">page 37</a> <cite>Parodies</cite>.
The corrections are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Verse 2, line <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> A tender mother&mdash;a devoted wife.</p>

<p>Verse 4, line <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> With vests, <em>he-mises</em>, with handkerchiefs,
and frills.</p>

<p>Verse 12, line <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> And scatter snowdrops as ye pass
along.</p>

<p>Verse 13, line <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> No fulsome epitaph, no flattering
trope.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>This concludes the Parodies, Imitations, and
Translations of Gray’s <cite>Elegy in a Country
Church Yard</cite>. Such a collection has never
before been attempted; every endeavour has
been made to gather materials from all available
sources, and it is believed that no parody
of any interest, or merit, has been omitted.
Should, however, attention be drawn to any
omission, mention will be made of it in a
future issue.</p>

<p>A parody, entitled “Ode on the amputation of a Cat’s
Tail,” was published by B. Flower, Cambridge, 1795, in a
pamphlet entitled “<cite>Scraps and Essays</cite>, by a Cantab.”</p>

<p>There is no merit in the parody to atone for the choice of
such a disgusting theme for an ode.</p>

<p>Another political imitation of this ode appeared in <cite>The
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s Chronicle</cite> relating to John, Earl of Bute, the
Prime Minister in 1762, who was so bitterly attacked by
Junius, and John Wilkes. This nobleman, who had been
tutor to George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, was nicknamed “Jack Boot,” and in
the popular caricatures of the day was represented as a large
jack boot surmounted by his head.</p>

<p>The parody possesses little interest, it commences thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="i2">And then farewell the good old school</div>

<div class="i1">Yet youthful Lord, and stripling Duke,</div>
<div class="i1">To beg for salt, without rebuke,</div>
<div class="i2">At Montem always were allowed:&mdash;</div>

<p>“This Society is now happily restored, and is supported by
men of every standing. The Debates, however, are restricted
to events previous to 1800: and no new subject is allowed
to be introduced after 10 o’clock.” So says the “<cite>Gradus ad
Cantabrigiam</cite>, or New University Guide to the Academical
Customs, and Colloquial or Cant terms peculiar to the University
of Cambridge,” written by a Brace of Cantabs, and
published by John Hearne, London, 1824. The parody is
taken from that amusing volume, it may also be found in
<cite>Facetiæ Cantabrigiensis</cite> (London: Charles Mason, 1836),
an anonymous collection of anecdotes and smart sayings
written by, or relating to, celebrated Cantabs.</p>

<p>The following imitation of “The Bard” is ascribed to the
Hon. Thomas Erskine (afterwards Lord Erskine) who wrote
it when a student at Trinity College, Cambridge. Having
<span class="pageno">59</span>
been disappointed of the attendance of his college-barber, at
his lodgings over the shop of Mr. Jackson, an apothecary, he
was compelled to forego his <em>commons</em> in hall. Determined
to have his revenge, and to give his hairdresser a good <em>dressing</em>
he composed the following “Fragment of a Pindaric
Ode” wherein he poured forth his curses upon the whole race
of barbers, predicting their ruin in the simplicity of style to
be adopted by a future generation. The exact date of the
parody is not known, part of it is quoted in the <cite>Gradus ad
Cantabrigiam</cite>, which was published in 1824, it is also given

<p>“<cite>The Bostonian Prophet.</cite>” An Heroi-comico-serious-Parodical-Pindaric
<span class="sc">Ode</span>, in imitation of <cite>The Bard</cite>. With
Notes Critical, Satirical, and Explanatory, by the Editor.
London. C. Etherington, 1779. Quarto. This was a
parody relating to the American War of Independence,
the first act of which occurred in Boston in November,
1773, when the populace refused to pay the obnoxious tax
upon tea, and cast hundreds of chests of it into the sea.
The parody describes the corruption and inefficiency of
the English statesmen and commanders in language too
coarse to reprint, even if the Parody were of sufficient
present interest to render it desirable to do so.</p>

<p>There is another parody of Gray’s “Bard” which
cannot be inserted here, it may be found in “<cite>The Authentic
and Impartial Life of Mrs. Mary Anne Clarke</cite>,” by
W. Clarke, London. T. Kelly, 1809. This Mistress
Clarke lived for some time “under the protection” of
H.R.H. the Duke of York, Commander-in-Chief of the
British Army. She obtained large sums of money by the
sale of the commissions, appointments, and promotions
which were at the disposal of her royal, but ever needy,
lover. Finally an enquiry was held, and the Duke of
York was compelled to resign the office he had disgraced.
The parody above mentioned gives a history of the
scandal, but it would be unintelligible unless accompanied
by details of profligacy and corruption, such as are
unsuited for any work but the Newgate Calendar. In
addition to these parodies and imitations, <cite>The Bard</cite> was
translated into Welsh in 1822.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">THE DESCENT OF ODIN.</p>

<p>The following Parody of Gray’s “Descent of
Odin” was written by James Hay Beattie, son of
James Beattie, L.L.D., author of “The Minstrel.”
Young Beattie was born in 1768 and died in 1790.
In 1794, Dr. Beattie printed “Essays and Fragments
in Prose and Verse” by his son, but only for
private circulation.</p>

<p>Young Beattie had a clerical friend who made a
sea voyage from Aberdeen to Rotherhithe, and

<p>Gray’s Pindaric Odes were not very favorably received,
their chief fault being obscurity. Gray was pressed by
his friends to append explanatory notes, which, for a long
time, he declined to do, writing “I would not have put
another note to save the souls of all the owls in London.
It is extremely well as it is&mdash;nobody understands me, and
I am perfectly satisfied.” In 1760 there appeared two
burlesque odes by G. Colman and R. Lloyd, one inscribed
to “Obscurity”&mdash;That, said Gray, is me&mdash;the other to
“Oblivion,” which was directed against Mason. In these
parodies the friends Gray and Mason, are treated with
contempt both as men and poets. Gray wrote to his
fellow victim, “Lest people should not understand the
humour, letters come out in <cite>Lloyd’s Evening Post</cite> to tell
them who and what it was that he meant, and says it is
like to produce a great combustion in the literary world.
So if you have any mind to <em>combustle</em> about it, well and
good, for me, I am neither so literary nor so combustible.”
He also informed Dr. Wharton that a bookseller to whom
he was unknown, had recommended him to purchase the
satire upon himself as “a very pretty thing.” Gray was
too proud to show that he was hurt by these satires, but
he was too sensitive not to be annoyed at the ridicule, and
except a single piece which was written upon compulsion
(the Ode for the Installation of the Duke of Grafton), he
attempted no more serious verse. These “Odes to Obscurity
and Oblivion” are not now of sufficient interest
to be reprinted in full:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN
GILPIN.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>Showing how he went farther than he intended, and came safe
home again.</cite></p>

<p>The story of John Gilpin’s ride was related to Cowper by
his friend, Lady Austen, who had heard it as a child. It
caused the poet a sleepless night, we are told, as he was
kept awake by laughter at it. During these restless hours
he turned it into the famous ballad. It appeared in the
“Public Advertiser,” November 14th, 1782, anonymously.</p>

<p>A celebrated actor named Henderson took it for one of his
public recitations at Freemasons’ Hall. It became immediately
so popular that it was printed everywhere&mdash;in
newspapers, magazines, and separately. It was even sung

as a common ballad in the streets. It has fully preserved
its popularity to the present date.</p>

<p>The original John Gilpin was, it is said, a Mr. Beyer, a
linendraper, who, lived at the Cheapside corner of Paternoster
Row. He died in 1791, at the age of nearly a
hundred years.</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<div class="i1">John Gilpin was a citizen</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">John Gilpin’s spouse said to her dear,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He soon replied, “I do admire</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, “That’s well said</div>

<div class="i2">Which is both bright and clear.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">John Gilpin kissed his loving wife;</div>
<div class="i2">O’erjoyed was he to find</div>
<div class="i1">That, though on pleasure she was bent,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The morning came, the chaise was brought,</div>

<div class="i2">Should say that she was proud.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So three doors off the chaise was stayed,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,</div>
<div class="i2">Were never folks so glad!</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">John Gilpin at his horse’s side</div>
<div class="i2">Seized fast the flowing mane,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For saddle-tree scarce reached had he,</div>
<div class="i2">His journey to begin,</div>
<div class="i1">When, turning round his head, he saw</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So down he came; for loss of time,</div>
<div class="i2">Although it grieved him sore,</div>
<div class="i1">Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,</div>
<div class="i2">Would trouble him much more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">’Twas long before the customers</div>
<div class="i2">Were suited to their mind,</div>
<div class="i1">When Betty screaming, came downstairs&mdash;</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Good lack!” quoth he; “yet bring it me,</div>

<div class="i2">When I do exercise.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!)</div>
<div class="i2">Had two stone bottles found,</div>

<div class="i1">Now see him mounted once again</div>
<div class="i2">Upon his nimble steed,</div>
<div class="i1">Full slowly pacing o’er the stones,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But finding soon a smoother road</div>
<div class="i2">Beneath his well-shod feet,</div>
<div class="i1">The snorting beast began to trot,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So “Fair and Softly,” John he cried,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So stooping down, as needs he must</div>

<div class="i1">His horse, who never in that sort</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Away went Gilpin, neck or nought;</div>
<div class="i2">Away went hat and wig;</div>
<div class="i1">He little dreamt when he set out,</div>
<div class="i2">Of running such a rig.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The wind did blow, the cloak did fly</div>
<div class="i2">Like streamer long and gay,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then might all people well discern</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The dogs did bark, the children screamed.</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Away went Gilpin&mdash;who but he?</div>
<div class="i2">His fame soon spread around:</div>
<div class="i1">“He carries weight!” “He rides a race!”</div>
<div class="i2">“’Tis for a thousand pound!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And still, as fast as he drew near,</div>
<div class="i2">’Twas wonderful to view</div>
<div class="i1">How in a trice the turnpike men</div>
<div class="i2">Their gates wide open threw.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And now, as he went bowing down</div>
<div class="i2">His reeking head full low,</div>
<div class="i1">The bottles twain behind his back</div>
<div class="i2">Were shattered at a blow.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Down ran the wine into the road,</div>
<div class="i2">Most piteous to be seen,</div>

<div class="i2">As they had basted been.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pageno">66</span>
<div class="i1">But still he seemed to carry weight,</div>

<div class="i1">For all might see the bottle-necks</div>
<div class="i2">Still dangling at his waist.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Thus all through merry Islington</div>
<div class="i2">These gambols he did play,</div>
<div class="i1">Until he came unto the Wash</div>
<div class="i2">Of Edmonton so gay;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And there he threw the Wash about,</div>
<div class="i2">On both sides of the way,</div>
<div class="i1">Just like unto a trundling mop,</div>
<div class="i2">Or a wild goose at play.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">At Edmonton, his loving wife</div>
<div class="i2">From the balcony spied</div>
<div class="i1">Her tender husband, wondering much</div>
<div class="i2">To see how he did ride.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Stop, stop, John Gilpin!&mdash;Here’s the house!”</div>
<div class="i2">They all at once did cry;</div>
<div class="i1">“The dinner waits, and we are tired.”</div>
<div class="i2">Said Gilpin, “So am I!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But yet his horse was not a whit</div>
<div class="i2">Inclined to tarry there;</div>
<div class="i1">For why?&mdash;his owner had a house</div>
<div class="i2">Full ten miles off, at Ware.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So like an arrow swift he flew,</div>
<div class="i2">Shot by an archer strong;</div>
<div class="i1">So did he fly&mdash;which brings me to</div>
<div class="i2">The middle of my song.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Away went Gilpin, out of breath,</div>
<div class="i2">And sore against his will,</div>
<div class="i1">Till, at his friend the calender’s,</div>
<div class="i2">His horse at last stood still.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The calender amazed to see</div>
<div class="i2">His neighbour in such trim,</div>
<div class="i1">Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,</div>
<div class="i2">And thus accosted him:&mdash;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“What news? what news? your tidings tell?</div>
<div class="i2">Tell me you must and shall&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Say why bareheaded you are come,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,</div>

<p>The above verses in the handwriting of Cowper were
found among Mrs. Unwin’s papers, with a drawing, supposed
to be by Romney, of Mrs. Gilpin sitting on the top
of a gate. The idea seems to be that Mrs. Gilpin having
tired waiting for her husband, wandered into the fields,
and in an attempt to get over one of those awkward
styles for which Enfield was then famous, got upon
the top, but could not get down again. The drawing is
very ludicrous.</p>

<p>Thomas Moore’s biography of Lord Byron was severely
criticised, both for what it contained and for what it
omitted. That Moore, the cherished friend of the great
poet, should display all the faults and frailties of Lord
Byron was ungenerous and ungrateful, but his ill-judged
suppression of certain important matters of fact was far
more inexcusable and damaging to Byron’s reputation.</p>

<p>Two parodies of this poem appeared in <cite>Figaro in London</cite>
more than fifty years ago, they are consequently rather out
of date, and it is unnecessary to give them in full.</p>

<p>The first referred to Henry Phillpotts, the stern, mercenary,
and bigoted Bishop of Exeter, the bitter opponent of Roman
Catholic emancipation, and the apologist for the Peterloo
massacre. The second is supposed to be a complaint made
by Lord Grey on his rejection from the office of premier by
his late colleagues.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="decoration">A Lyric for the 20th August</span>, 1853.)</p>

<p>A military camp was held during the summer months of
1853 at Chobham, and became a favourite place of resort for
Londoners.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">The Camp has departed!&mdash;farewell the parade,</div>
<div class="i1">And the earth-shaking march of the stern Colonade:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_70"

<div class="i1">The bands play no longer from manuscript leaves,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor detectives prowl stealthily watching the thieves.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The City of War, which immense fun we’ve had in</div>
<div class="i1">Is fled like the palace that flew with Aladdin;</div>

<div class="i1">Where gallop’d in glory those terrible Greys.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">No longer in toothsome libation is spilt</div>
<div class="i1">The Dew that is dear to the sons of the kilt;</div>
<div class="i1">No longer falls plashing in pleasantness here,</div>
<div class="i1">The frothy cascade of the black British beer,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">O! Chobham Olympics, your games are all done,</div>
<div class="i1">The last close is wrestled, the last race is run,</div>
<div class="i1">The stone’s “put” away, to the leap-frog there’s truce,</div>
<div class="i1">And the ultimate caber is pitched to the deuce.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Rejoice in thy stable, thou omnibus steed!</div>
<div class="i1">For thee the campaign-times were wiry indeed,</div>
<div class="i1">No more shalt thou toil on that villanous road,</div>
<div class="i1">With a cargo of snobs for thy heart-breaking load.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Weep, rascally drivers of ramshackle flies,</div>
<div class="i1">Adieu your extortions, your sauce, and your lies,</div>
<div class="i1">Farewell to that Station, the cheating point where</div>
<div class="i1">You’ve so oft charged a pound for a two shilling fare.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Well, everything passes; a Camp like the rest,</div>
<div class="i1">But this ends while its novelty still has a zest;</div>
<div class="i1">And we’re free to confess that we see with regret</div>
<div class="i1">The Flutters Hill’s sun, like the Austerlitz set.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Here’s a health to the officer&mdash;liner or guard&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Who with Cambridge and Seaton has laboured so hard,</div>
<div class="i1">Here’s a health to his men, whose good looks and good will</div>
<div class="i1">Did such excellent credit to messman and drill.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The object was good, and the object is gained,</div>
<div class="i1">Right sound is the teaching the troops have obtained;</div>
<div class="i1">And we’ll mark that M.P. for a short-sighted scamp</div>
<div class="i1">Who grudges one mil for the Chobhamite Camp.</div>

<p>In 1813 Leigh Hunt and his brother, as proprietors of
<cite>The Examiner</cite>, were sentenced to undergo two years imprisonment,
and each to pay a fine of five hundred pounds,
for publishing an article in that paper containing the
following remarks on the Prince Regent:&mdash;</p>

<p>“What person would imagine in reading these astounding
eulogies in <cite>The Morning Post</cite>, that this ‘Glory of the
people’ was the subject of millions of shrugs and
reproaches! That this ‘Conqueror of Hearts’ was the
disappointer of hopes! That this ‘Exciter of Desire’
(Bravo, <cite>Morning Post</cite>!), this ‘Adonis in Loveliness’ was
a corpulent man of fifty! In short, this <em>delightful</em>, <em>blissful</em>,
<em>wise</em>, <em>pleasureable</em>, <em>honourable</em>, <em>virtuous</em>, <em>true and immortal</em>
Prince was a violator of his word, a libertine over head
and ears in disgrace, a despiser of domestic ties, the companion
of gamblers and demireps, a man who has just
closed half a century without one single claim on the
gratitude of his country, or the respect of posterity.”</p>

<p>The Hunts were informed that if they would undertake
to abstain from commenting on the actions of the Prince
Regent for the future, the sentence would be remitted.
They declined to give the required undertaking, but paid
their fines, and went to prison. The severity of the
sentence caused great delight to the friends of the Prince
Regent, and Theodore Hook wrote the following apropos
parody of Cowper’s poem on Alexander Selkirk:&mdash;</p>

<div class="i1">I met a little cottage Girl;</div>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">New Peers.</span></p>

<p>The Poet Wordsworth is supposed to propose to King
William <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> that he, with Coleridge, Southey, Rogers,
Campbell, Moore, and Croly shall be made Peers, there
being then a necessity to create Peers in order to carry
the Reform Bill, which had already passed the Commons.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Trustee.</span></p>

<p class="center">(<em>A True Story.</em>)</p>

<p>The subject is that of a Trustee, who has been persuaded
to accept a trust under the persuasion that as a mere trustee
of property, the enjoyment of which he has nothing to do
with, no liability of any kind can possibly attach to him.
The simplicity with which he adheres to the impression of
his being only a trustee, while suits at Law and in Equity,
with their consequent costs, shower down upon him, will
remind the reader of the innocent exclamation of “We are
Seven!” so affectingly persisted in by the little child in the
famous poem of Wordsworth.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">A simple creature Gaffer Jones,</div>
<div class="i2">A Court he never saw;</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He had a quiet stupid air,</div>
<div class="i2">And he was richly clad;</div>
<div class="i1">I thought if he’s got cash to spare,</div>
<div class="i2">’Tis easy to be had.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A suit I heard was ’gainst him brought,</div>
<div class="i2">Which must expensive be.</div>
<div class="i1">“Expense!” he cried; Pooh pooh, ’tis nought;</div>
<div class="i2">I’m only a trustee.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“But how is that? I pray you tell.”</div>
<div class="i2">He answered, “Don’t you see?</div>
<div class="i1">I’d got some property to sell&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Only as a trustee.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Two purchasers they did apply,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“The first from Chancery got a writ,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“And when I’d parted with it, Sir,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“First, the original vendee</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“How many suits must you defend,</div>

<p>Mr. W. Davenport Adams has asserted that the second
verse of the above was written by Mrs. Wordsworth. Now
Wordsworth was not married until 1802, three years after
the poem on “Lucy” was written, and it seems very improbable
that Mary Hutchinson would have contributed a verse
praising a former sweetheart, even although she were dead.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">THE REJECTED ADDRESSES.</p>

<p>Wordsworth was one of the authors selected to be
imitated in <cite>The Rejected Addresses</cite>. These were supposed to
be the compositions sent in by competing poets on the
occasion of the opening of the new Drury Lane Theatre in
October, 1812. They were all written by the Brothers

James and Horace Smith, this imitation of Wordsworth
being the work of James Smith.</p>

<p><cite>The Edinburgh Review</cite> for November, 1812, contained
an article (written by Jeffrey) on <cite>The Rejected Addresses</cite>, in
which, referring to this particular poem, the reviewer
remarks:&mdash;“The author does not attempt to copy any of
the higher attributes of Mr. Wordsworth’s poetry; but
has succeeded perfectly in the imitation of his mawkish
affectations of childish simplicity and nursery stammering.
We hope it will make him ashamed of his ‘Alice Fell,’
and the greater part of his last volumes&mdash;of which it is by
no means a parody, but a very fair, and indeed we think a
flattering imitation.”</p>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">Billy Blinn.</span></div>
<div class="i1">I knew a man that died for love,</div>
<div class="i3">His name, I ween, was Billy Blinn;</div>
<div class="i1">His back was hump’d, his hair was grey,</div>
<div class="i1">And, on a sultry summer day,</div>
<div class="i3">We found him floating in the linn.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Once as we stood before his door</div>
<div class="i3">Smoking, and wondering who should pass,</div>
<div class="i1">Then trundling past him in a cart</div>
<div class="i1">Came Susan Foy, she won his heart,</div>
<div class="i3">She was a gallant lass.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And Billy Blinn conceal’d the flame</div>
<div class="i3">That burn’d, and scorch’d his very blood;</div>
<div class="i1">But often was he heard to sigh,</div>
<div class="i1">And with his sleeve he wiped his eye,</div>
<div class="i3">In a dejected mood.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A party of recruiters came</div>
<div class="i3">To wile our cottars, man and boy;</div>
<div class="i1">Their coats were red, their cuffs were blue,</div>
<div class="i1">And boldly, without more ado,</div>
<div class="i3">Off with the troop went Susan Foy!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">When poor old Billy heard the news,</div>
<div class="i3">He tore his hairs so thin and grey;</div>
<div class="i1">He beat the hump upon his back,</div>
<div class="i1">And ever did he cry, “Alack,</div>
<div class="i3">Ohon, oh me!&mdash;alas a-day!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">His nights were spent in sleeplessness,</div>
<div class="i3">His days in sorrow and despair,</div>
<div class="i1">It could not last&mdash;this inward strife;</div>
<div class="i1">The lover he grew tired of life,</div>
<div class="i3">And saunter’d here and there.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">At length, ’twas  on a moonlight eve,</div>
<div class="i3">The skies were blue, the winds were still;</div>
<div class="i1">He wander’d from his wretched hut,</div>
<div class="i1">And, though he left the door unshut,</div>
<div class="i3">He sought the lonely hill.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He look’d upon the lovely moon,</div>
<div class="i3">He look’d upon the twinkling stars;</div>
<div class="i1">“How peaceful all is there,” he said,</div>
<div class="i1">“No noisy tumult there is bred,</div>
<div class="i3">And no intestine wars.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But misery overcame his heart,</div>
<div class="i3">For all was waste and war within;</div>
<div class="i1">And rushing forward with a leap,</div>
<div class="i1">O’er crags a hundred fathoms steep,</div>
<div class="i3">He plunged into the linn.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">We found him when the morning sun</div>
<div class="i3">Shone brightly from the eastern sky;</div>
<div class="i1">Upon his back he was afloat&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">His hat was sailing like a boat&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">His staff was found on high.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Oh reckless woman, Susan Foy,</div>
<div class="i3">To leave the poor, old, loving man,</div>
<div class="i1">And with a soldier, young and gay,</div>
<div class="i1">Thus harlot-like to run away</div>
<div class="i3">To India or Japan.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Poor Billy Blinn, with hair so white</div>
<div class="i3">Poor Billy Blinn was stiff and cold;</div>
<div class="i1">Will Adze he made a coffin neat,</div>

<p>This parody was written by Miss Catherine Maria Fanshawe,
and is included in her “Literary Remains,” published
in 1876 by B. M. Pickering, London. In a foot note
to the parody it is stated that a distinguished lady friend,

surprised that he had never shown it to her.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">PETER BELL.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Peter Bell</span>: A Lyrical Ballad. London.
Printed for Taylor &amp; Hessey, 93, Fleet Street.
1819.</p>

<p>Such is the title of an amusing parody, contained
in a small pamphlet of 29 pages, with
Preface, Poem, and Foot-notes, all in ridicule
of the vanity and egotism of the author of
the real original “<cite>Peter Bell</cite>.” The Preface
states:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“It is now a period of one-and-twenty years since I first
wrote some of the most perfect compositions that ever
dropped from poetical pen. My heart hath been right and
powerful all its years. I never thought an evil or a weak
thought in my life. It has been my aim and my achievement
to deduce moral thunder from buttercups, daisies,
celandines, and (as a poet scarcely inferior to myself, hath
it) ‘such small deer.’ Accustomed to mountain solitudes,
I can look with a calm and dispassionate eye upon that
fiend-like, vulture-souled, adder-fanged critic, whom I have
not patience to name, and of whose Review I loathe the
title, and detest the contents. Philosophy has taught me to
forgive the misguided miscreant, and to speak of him only
in terms of patience and pity.</p>

<p class="blockquote">My ballads are the noblest pieces of verse in the whole
range of English poetry: and I take this opportunity of
telling the world I am a great man. Milton was also a
great man. Ossian was a blind old fool. Copies of my
previous works may be had in any numbers, by application
at my publisher.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Of <cite>Peter Bell</cite> I have only thus much to say: it completes
the simple system of natural narrative which I began
so early as 1798.</p>

<p class="blockquote">It is written in that pure unlaboured style which can only
be met with among labourers; and I can safely say that its
occasional meaning occasionally falls far below the meanest
capacity. I commit my ballad confidently to posterity. I
love to read my own poetry: it does my heart good.”</p>

<p class="quotesig">W. W.</p>

<p>The parody consists of 42 stanzas, and relates how
Peter Bell, visiting the churchyard, comes across a gravestone
on which is engraved W. W.</p>

<p>There has been some speculation as to the author of this
parody, and as far back as 1866 the following letter appeared
in <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“It was Reynolds, too, who, in 1819, anticipated the
genuine <cite>Peter Bell</cite> of Wordsworth by a spurious <cite>Peter Bell</cite>,
in which were exhibited and exaggerated the characteristics
of Wordsworth’s earlier <em>simplicitas</em>.</p>

<p class="blockquote">I knew Reynolds, and often talked to him about <cite>Peter
Bell</cite>. Wordsworth’s poem had been advertised, but its
publication was from time to time put off. Some literary
men were guessing at the cause of this delay, and one
said, Wordsworth is keeping it back to elaborate. ‘Elaborate!’
said Reynolds, ‘I’ll see if I can’t get one out before
him.’ He set to work that afternoon, and sent his poem to
the printer the next evening. I think it was out about a
fortnight before Wordsworth’s. Up to the publication of
<cite>Peter Bell</cite>, they were literary friends, and occasionally exchanged
letters. The joke annoyed Wordsworth, who gave
up the acquaintance.”</p>

<p>Shelley also wrote a parody of <cite>Peter Bell</cite>.</p>

<p>A parody entitled “<cite>The Dead Asses</cite>, a Lyrical Ballad”
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pageno">105</span>
was also published in 1819, but no copy of it can be found
in the British Museum Library.</p>

tale in verse.” A Fragment. London, Baldwin. 1819.

<p>This clever burlesque of “Peter Bell,” is an octavo of
96 pages, and consists of an Introduction, the poem, and
some very prolix notes, all in ludicrous imitation of
Wordsworth.</p>

<p>Messrs. J. W. Jarvis &amp; Son, booksellers, of King William
Street, Strand, have a scarce little work from which they
kindly allow the following extracts to be made:&mdash;</p>

<p>The book is entitled “The Private Libraries of Philadelphia,”
and describes the curious Bibliographical collection
made by Mr. George W. Childs, of that city.</p>

<p>This catalogue is by Mr. F. W. Robinson, and printed by
Collins, of Philadelphia, in 1883.</p>

<p>Mention in it is made of a six volume edition of Lord
Byron’s works presented to Mr. Childs by John Murray, the
publisher. In the first volume of this set is inserted a copy
of Wordsworth’s poem <cite>Peter Bell</cite>, a poem for which Lord
Byron, who generally disliked Wordsworth’s poetry, had a
special aversion, and in this copy he had scribbled on the
margin a parody of the commencement of the poem. This
parody has not hitherto been published in England.</p>

<p>Wordsworth’s <cite>Peter Bell</cite> commences thus:</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">WORDSWORTH AS POET LAUREATE.</p>

<p>On the death of Robert Southey, in 1843,
the appointment of Poet Laureate was offered
to Wordsworth. At first he declined on the
plea that he was too far advanced in life to
undertake the duties of the office; thereupon
Sir Robert Peel wrote:&mdash;“Do not be deterred
by the fear of any obligations which the appointment
may be supposed to imply. I will
undertake that you shall have <em>nothing required</em>
from you.” Thus pressed, Wordsworth accepted
the title and the pension, he being
already in the receipt of a handsome annuity
from the Government. The warrant was dated
April 6, 1843, and he retained the office till
his death in 1850. He wrote a sonnet on the
occasion of his appointment, which for vanity
and egotism is probably unparallelled in literature,
but beyond this he paid little further
attention, either to the office, or its ancient
duties.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_79"

<p>The poetical fame of Coleridge rests principally
upon <cite>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</cite>, and
<cite>Christabel</cite>, both of which are so well known
that it is quite unnecessary to reprint them,
especially as Messrs. Ward, Lock &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> have
recently published a very cheap and handy
edition of the miscellaneous poems of Coleridge,
containing the above, as well as some other
poems which, being less known, have not given
rise to so many parodies.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">THE ANCIENT MARINER.</p>

<p>This weird poem was founded on a strange dream
which a friend of Coleridge had, who fancied he saw a
skeleton ship, with figures in it. Wordsworth wrote a
few lines of it, and the idea of shooting an albatross
appears to have been his. As Coleridge himself informs
us, it was planned and partly composed during a walk
with Wordsworth and his sister, in the autumn of
1797. It was first published in 1798, in a volume entitled
“<cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite>, with a few other Poems,” Bristol,
1798. It is the opening poem of the volume, and is
quaintly styled “<cite>The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere</cite>,” in
seven parts. Most of the other poems in the volume
were written by Wordsworth. The first version contained
a stanza (the eleventh in Part <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>) which has been
omitted from all subsequent reprints:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">“His bones were black with many a crack,</div>
<div class="i2">All black and bare I ween;</div>
<div class="i1">Jet black and bare, save where with rust,</div>
<div class="i1">Of mouldy damps and charnel crust</div>
<div class="i2">They were patch’d with purple and green.”</div>

<div class="i1">“I see your yacht upon the shore,</div>
<div class="i2">Dancing right merrily;</div>
<div class="i1">But then my wife, ere we came out,</div>
<div class="i2">Said, ‘Mind, be home to tea.’</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“My dame she hath an angry tongue,</div>
<div class="i2">And if that we should not</div>
<div class="i1">Be back at five, I fear that we</div>

<div class="i1">“Besides, when out upon the waves,</div>
<div class="i2">The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mal du mer</i> I fear.”</div>
<div class="i1">“Lord bless you,” quoth the mariner,</div>
<div class="i2">“We ain’t caught one this year!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“And you’ll be back by half-past four,</div>
<div class="i2">In lots of time for tea.”</div>
<div class="i1">“You promised, Pa, we’d have a sail,”</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Appeal’d to thus, in sore perplex,</div>
<div class="i2">The father gave consent;</div>
<div class="i1">And, oh! he thought how sick he’d be,</div>
<div class="i2">As to the boat he went.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The sun was high, the wind was low,</div>
<div class="i2">And as the party sail,</div>
<div class="i1">These words rang in the father’s ears,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And now they’re launch’d upon the deep,</div>
<div class="i2">The yacht, like any witch,</div>

<div class="i2">For Ocean claimed his due.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He heard his children playing round,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He had not strength to punch his head,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor eke to box his ear;</div>
<div class="i1">The words were true, and he did feel</div>
<div class="i2">Particularly queer.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And worst of all, the while he paid</div>
<div class="i2">His tribute to the sea,</div>
<div class="i1">A voice kept ringing in his ear:</div>
<div class="i2">“You won’t be home to tea!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="i2">He cried in accents weak;</div>

<div class="i2">The quid within his cheek.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">His cruel offsprings then began</div>

<div class="poemdivider"><cite>The Wedding Guest’s Version of the Affair <br />from his
Point of View.</cite></div>
<div class="i1">It is an Ancient Mariner,</div>
<div class="i2">And he stoppeth one of three&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">In fact he coolly took my arm&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">“There was a ship,” quoth he.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Bother your ships!” said I. “Is this</div>
<div class="i2">The time a yarn to spin?</div>
<div class="i1">This is a wedding, don’t you see,</div>
<div class="i2">And I am next of kin.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“The wedding-breakfast has begun,</div>
<div class="i2">We’re hungry as can be&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Hold off! Unhand me, longshore man!”</div>
<div class="i2">With that his hand dropt he.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But there was something in his eye</div>
<div class="i2">That made me sick and ill,</div>
<div class="i1">Yet forced to listen to his yarn&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">The Mariner’d had his swill.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">While Tom and Harry went their way</div>
<div class="i2">I sat upon a stone&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">So queer on Fanny’s wedding-day</div>
<div class="i2">Me sitting there alone!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then he began, that Mariner,</div>
<div class="i2">To rove from pole to pole,</div>
<div class="i1">In one long-winded, lengthened-out,</div>
<div class="i2">Eternal rigmarole,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">About a ship in which he’d sailed,</div>
<div class="i2">Though whither, goodness knows,</div>
<div class="i1">Where “ice will split with a thunder-fit,”</div>
<div class="i2">And every day it snows.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And then about a precious bird</div>
<div class="i2">Of some sort or another,</div>
<div class="i1">That&mdash;was such nonsence ever heard?&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Used to control the weather!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now, at this bird the Mariner</div>
<div class="i2">Resolved to have a shy,</div>
<div class="i1">And laid it low with his cross-bow&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">And then the larks! My eye!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For loss of that uncommon fowl</div>
<div class="i2">They couldn’t get a breeze;</div>
<div class="i1">And there they stuck, all out of luck,</div>
<div class="i2">And rotted on the seas.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The crew all died, or seemed to die,</div>
<div class="i2">And he was left alone</div>
<div class="i1">With that queer bird. You never heard</div>
<div class="i2">What games were carried on!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">At last one day he stood and watched</div>
<div class="i2">The fishes in the sea,</div>
<div class="i1">And said, “I’m blest!” and so the ship</div>
<div class="i2">Was from the spell set free!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And it began to rain and blow,</div>
<div class="i2">And as it rained and blew,</div>
<div class="i1">The dead got up and worked the ship&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">That was a likely crew!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">However, somehow he escaped,</div>
<div class="i2">And got again to land;</div>
<div class="i1">But mad as any hatter, say,</div>
<div class="i2">From Cornhill to the Strand.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><span class="pageno">117</span>
<div class="i1">For he believes that certain folks</div>
<div class="i2">Are singled out by fate,</div>
<div class="i1">To whom this cock-and-bull affair</div>
<div class="i2">Of his he must relate.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Describing all the incidents,</div>
<div class="i2">And painting all the scenes,</div>
<div class="i1">As sailors will do in the tales</div>
<div class="i2">They tell to the Marines.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Confound the Ancient Mariner!</div>
<div class="i2">I knew I should be late;</div>
<div class="i1">And so it was: the wedding guests</div>
<div class="i2">Had all declined to wait.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Another had my place, and gave</div>
<div class="i2">My toast; and sister Fan</div>
<div class="i1">Said, “’Twas a shame. What <em>could</em> you want</div>
<div class="i2">With that seafaring man?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I felt like one that had been stunned</div>
<div class="i2">Through all this wrong and scorn;</div>
<div class="i1">A sadder and a later man</div>
<div class="i2">I rose the morrow morn.</div>

<p>In 1884 there was a parody competition in the columns of
<cite>Truth</cite> on portions of <cite>The Ancient Mariner</cite>, the topic selected
by the Puzzle Editor being the filthy state of the River
Thames. Nine of these parodies were printed in <cite>Truth</cite>,

it will be sufficient to quote one only:&mdash;</p>

<p>This cruel and senseless fashion has, at last, been declared
“bad form.” No longer are birds to be worn in
bonnets or hats; and the edict has gone forth, both in
London and Paris, that those who wear them after this
ukase are to be regarded as provincials who know no
better. This resolution has been taken only just in time
to save some small remnant of the race of Humming Bird,
that “living flower,” and the Bird of Paradise.</p>

<p>Tom Hood’s “<cite>Comic Annual</cite>” for 1868 contained “The
Spiritual Parnassus” by a Literary Medium. This consists
of parodies on Lord Byron, Thomas Moore, and S.
T. Coleridge, written by the late Mr. William Jeffery
Prowse. The parody, or rather imitation of Coleridge’s
style is admitted to be the best of its kind ever written,
especially for its humorous description of the failings of
the “Old man eloquent.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear me preach, Charles?” asked
Coleridge of Lamb one day.</p>

<p>“I n-n-n-never heard you do anything else,” stammered
Lamb in reply.</p>

Rogers. “Wordsworth and I walked to Highgate to call
on him, when he was living at Gillman’s. We sat with
him two hours, he talking the whole time without intermission.
When we left the house, we walked for some
time without speaking. ‘What a wonderful man he is!’
exclaimed Wordsworth. ‘Wonderful indeed,’ said I.
‘What a depth of thought, what richness of expression,’
continued Wordsworth. ‘There’s nothing like him that
I ever heard!’ rejoined I. Another pause. ‘Pray,’ inquired
Wordsworth, ‘did you precisely understand what
he said about the Kantian philosophy?’ R. ‘Not precisely.’
W. ‘Or about the plurality of worlds?’ R. ‘I
can’t say I did. In fact, if the truth must out, I did not
understand a syllable from one end of his monologue to
the other.’ W. ‘No more did I.’”&mdash;<cite>Table Talk of

<p>Mr. William Jeffery Prowse was born at Torquay on
May 6, 1836, and died of consumption at Nice, on Easter
Sunday, 1870. He was a journalist by profession, being
more particularly connected with <cite>The Daily Telegraph</cite> as
a leader writer, and with <cite>Fun</cite>. He had a great fund of
humour, and a singular faculty of imitation, witness his
“Prize Essays,” and a series of papers he contributed to
<cite>The Porcupine</cite>, in which he adopted the modes of thought
and expression of eminent writers of the day, without descending
to mere parody of subject or language. In this
he rivalled the success achieved by the brothers Smith in
<cite>Rejected Addresses</cite>. The “Nicholas Notes” in <cite>Fun</cite> were
also from his pen. They cleverly burlesque the prophets
of the sporting papers, whose ambiguous utterances can
be always afterwards explained to be in perfect accordance
with what has come to pass. <cite>Nicholas</cite> is addicted to
the bottle, is always impecunious, and is always just
about to bring out a history of <cite>Knurr and Spell</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>The Rime of the Ancient Waggonere</cite>, in four parts. This
parody first appeared in <cite>Blackwood’s Magazine</cite>, February,
1819, it was republished in vol. 2 of J. S. Moore’s <cite>Pictorial
Book of Ballad Poetry</cite> (London, 1849), and again in William
Maginn’s <cite>Miscellanies</cite> (London, 1885.)</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">CHRISTABEL.</p>

<p>This most exquisite fragment of a poem, Coleridge’s masterpiece,
was commenced in 1797, the second part was written
in 1800, leaving the mystery of the plot still unsolved.</p>

<p>For this Coleridge blamed his indolence, but possibly he
gave up the task in despair, he must have felt how inferior
the second part was in interest, in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">diablerie</i>, and in poetical
fancy to the first, and that no ending was preferable to a tame
ending of a work which had aroused such intense admiration
and curiosity. Others have attempted to complete the poem,
in sober earnest, but their efforts have been unsuccessful, and
not one sequel has achieved even a temporary popularity.</p>

<p>In the first edition of the poem Coleridge, after describing
<cite>Geraldine</cite> added:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">“A sight to dream of, not to tell:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And she is to sleep with Christabel!”</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>He afterwards omitted these lines possibly because he
heard it reported that <cite>Geraldine</cite> was to prove to be a man,
and not as <cite>Christabel</cite> supposes, a forlorn maiden in distress.
Be this as it may some of the parodies dwell particularly

upon the equivocal situation of <cite>Christabel</cite> with her stranger
guest. Principal amongst these parodies is one written by
Dr. Maginn which appeared in <cite>Blackwood’s Magazine</cite> as far
back as June 1819. In order to appreciate this, a few
extracts from the narrative portion of Part I. of the original
must be given. Want of space alone is the reason for
mutilating the poem, enough is left to trace the story to
where Dr. Maginn takes up the thread.</p>

<div class="i1">And now doth Geraldine press down</div>
<div class="i1">The rushes of the chamber floor.</div>
<div class="i1">The silver lamp burns dead and dim;</div>
<div class="i1">But Christabel the lamp will trim.</div>
<div class="i1">She trimmed the lamp, and made it bright,</div>
<div class="i1">And left it swinging to und fro,</div>
<div class="i1">While Geraldine, in wretched plight,</div>
<div class="i1">Sank down upon the floor below.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">O weary lady, Geraldine,</div>
<div class="i1">I pray you, drink this cordial wine!</div>
<div class="i1">It is a wine of virtuous powers;</div>
<div class="i1">My mother made it of wild flowers.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i2">Again the wild-flower wine she drank:</div>
<div class="i1">Her fair large eyes ’gan glitter bright,</div>
<div class="i1">And from the floor whereon she sank,</div>
<div class="i1">The lofty lady stood upright;</div>
<div class="i1">She was most beautiful to see,</div>
<div class="i1">Like a lady of a far countrée.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">And thus the lofty lady spake&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">All they, who live in the upper sky,</div>
<div class="i1">Do love you, holy Christabel!</div>
<div class="i1">And you love them, and for their sake</div>
<div class="i1">And for the good which me befell,</div>
<div class="i1">Even I in my degree will try,</div>
<div class="i1">Fair maiden, to requite you well.</div>
<div class="i1">But now unrobe yourself; for I</div>
<div class="i1">Must pray, ere yet in bed I lie.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Quoth Christabel, so let it be</div>
<div class="i1">And as the lady bade, did she.</div>
<div class="i1">Her gentle limbs did she undress,</div>
<div class="i1">And lay down in her loveliness.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">But through her brain of weal and woe</div>
<div class="i1">So many thoughts moved to and fro,</div>
<div class="i1">That vain it were her lids to close;</div>
<div class="i1">So half-way from the bed she rose:</div>
<div class="i1">And on her elbow did recline</div>
<div class="i1">To look at the lady Geraldine.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Beneath the lamp the lady bowed,</div>
<div class="i1">And slowly rolled her eyes around;</div>
<div class="i1">Then drawing in her breath aloud</div>
<div class="i1">Like one that shuddered, she unbound</div>
<div class="i1">The cincture from beneath her breast:</div>
<div class="i1">Her silken robe, and inner vest,</div>
<div class="i1">Dropt to her feet, and full in view,</div>
<div class="i1">Behold! her bosom and half her side</div>
<div class="i1">A sight to dream of, not to tell!</div>
<div class="i1">O shield her! shield sweet Christabel!</div>
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pageno">129</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Yet Geraldine nor speaks nor stirs;</div>
<div class="i1">Ah! what a stricken look was hers!</div>
<div class="i1">Deep from within she seems half-way</div>
<div class="i1">To lift some weight with sick assay,</div>
<div class="i1">And eyes the maid and seeks delay;</div>
<div class="i1">Then suddenly as one defied</div>
<div class="i1">Collects herself in scorn and pride,</div>
<div class="i1">And lay down by the maiden’s side</div>
<div class="i1">And in her arms the maid she took,</div>
<div class="i5">Ah well-a-day!</div>
<div class="i1">And with low voice and doleful look</div>
<div class="i5">These words did say:</div>
<div class="i1">In the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell,</div>
<div class="i1">Which is lord of thy utterance, Christabel!</div>
<div class="i1">Thou knowest to-night, and wilt know to-morrow</div>
<div class="i1">This mark of my shame, this seal of my sorrow;</div>
<div class="i5">But vainly thou warrest,</div>
<div class="i6">For this is alone in</div>
<div class="i5">Thy power to declare,</div>
<div class="i6">That in the dim forest</div>
<div class="i5">Thou heard’st a low moaning,</div>
<div class="i1">And found’st a bright lady, surpassingly fair:</div>
<div class="i1">And didst bring her home with thee in love and in charity,</div>
<div class="i1">To shield her and shelter her from the damp air.</div>

<div class="poemdivider"><cite>Christabel. Part <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></cite></div>
<div class="i1">Nine moons have waxed, and the tenth, in its wane,</div>
<div class="i1">Sees Christabel struggle in unknown pain!</div>
<div class="i1">&mdash;For many moons was her eye less bright,</div>
<div class="i1">For many moons was her vest more tight,</div>
<div class="i1">And her cheek was pale, save when, with a start,</div>
<div class="i1">The life blood came from the panting heart,</div>
<div class="i1">And fluttering, o’er that thin fair face</div>
<div class="i1">Past with a rapid nameless pace,</div>
<div class="i1">And at moments a big tear filled the eye,</div>
<div class="i1">And at moments a short and smothered sigh</div>
<div class="i1">Swelled her breast with sudden strain,</div>
<div class="i1">Breathed half in grief, and half in pain,</div>
<div class="i1">For her’s are pangs, on the rack that wind</div>
<div class="i1">The outward frame and the inward mind.</div>
<div class="i1">&mdash;And when at night she did visit the oak,</div>
<div class="i1">She wore the Baron’s scarlet cloak,</div>
<div class="i1">(That cloak which happy to hear and to tell</div>
<div class="i1">Was lined with the fur of the leopard well,)</div>
<div class="i1">And as she wandered down the dell</div>
<div class="i1">None said ’twas  the Lady Christabel.&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Some thought ’twas  a weird and ugsome elf,</div>
<div class="i1">Some deemed ’twas  the old sick Baron himself,</div>
<div class="i1">Who wandered beneath the snowy lift</div>
<div class="i1">To count his beads in solemn shrift&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">(For his shape below was wide to see</div>
<div class="i1">All bloated with the hydropsie.)</div>
<div class="i1">Oh! had her old father the secret known,</div>
<div class="i1">He had stood as stark as the statue of stone</div>
<div class="i1">That stands so silent, and white, and tall,</div>
<div class="i1">At the upper end of his banquet hall!</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Am I asleep or am I awake?</div>
<div class="i1">In very truth I oft mistake,</div>
<div class="i1">As the stories of old come over my brain,</div>
<div class="i1">And I build in spirit the mystic strain;&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Ah! would to the virgin that I were asleep!</div>
<div class="i1">But I must wake, and I must weep!</div>
<div class="i2">Sweet Christabel, it is not well</div>
<div class="i1">That a lady, pure as the sunless snow</div>
<div class="i1">That lies so soft on the mountain’s brow,</div>
<div class="i1">That a maiden of sinless chastity</div>
<div class="i1">In childbirth pangs should be doomed to die,</div>
<div class="i1">Or live with a name of sorrow and shame,</div>
<div class="i1">And hear the words of blemish and blame!</div>
<div class="i1">&mdash;For the world that smiles at the guilt of man,</div>
<div class="i1">Places woman beneath its ban;</div>
<div class="i1">Alas, that scandal thus should wreak</div>
<div class="i1">Its vengeance on the warm and weak,</div>
<div class="i1">That the arrows of the cold and dull</div>
<div class="i1">Should wound the breast of the beautiful!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Of the things that be did we know but half,</div>
<div class="i1">Many, and many would weep, who laugh!</div>
<div class="i1">Tears would darken many an eye,</div>
<div class="i1">Or that deeper grief, (when its orb is dry,</div>
<div class="i1">When it cannot dare the eye of day),</div>
<div class="i1">O’er the clouded heart would sway,</div>
<div class="i1">’Till it crumbled like desert dust away!</div>
<div class="i1">But here we meet with grief and grudge,</div>
<div class="i1">And they who cannot know us, judge!</div>
<div class="i1">Thus, souls on whom good angels smile,</div>
<div class="i1">Are scoffed at in our world of guile&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Let this, Ladiè, thy comfort be;</div>
<div class="i1">Man knows not us, good angels know</div>
<div class="i1">The things that pass in the world below;</div>
<div class="i1">And scarce, methinks, it seems unjust,</div>
<div class="i1">That the world should view thee with mistrust,</div>
<div class="i1">For who that saw that child of thine</div>
<span class="pageno">130</span>
<div class="i1">Pale Christabel, who could divine</div>
<div class="i1">That its sire was the Ladie Geraldine.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But in I rush, with too swift a gale,</div>
<div class="i1">Into the ocean of my tale!</div>
<div class="i1">Not yet young Christabel, I ween,</div>

<div class="i1">&mdash;’Tis the month of the snow and the blast,</div>
<div class="i1">And the days of Christmas mirth are past,</div>
<div class="i1">When the oak-roots heaped on the hearth blazed bright,</div>
<div class="i1">Casting a broad and dusky light</div>
<div class="i1">On the shadowy forms of the warriors old,</div>
<div class="i1">Who stared from the wall, most grim to behold&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">On shields where the spider his tapestry weaves,</div>
<div class="i1">On the holly boughs and the ivy leaves,</div>
<div class="i1">The few green glories that still remain</div>
<div class="i1">To mock the storm and welcome the rain,</div>
<div class="i1">Brighter and livelier mid tempest and shower,</div>
<div class="i1">Like a hero in the battle hour!&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Brave emblems o’er the winter hearth,</div>
<div class="i1">They cheered our fathers’ hours of mirth!&mdash;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Twelve solar months complete and clear</div>

<div class="i1">Three times ten are fair and white,</div>
<div class="i1">Three times ten are black as night,</div>
<div class="i1">Three times ten hath Hecatè,</div>
<div class="i1">Three times ten the God of day;</div>
<div class="i1">Thus spoke the old hierophant</div>
<div class="i1">(I saw her big breast swelling pant)</div>
<div class="i1">What time, I dreamed, in ghostly wise</div>
<div class="i1">Of Eleusinian mysteries,</div>
<div class="i1">For I am the hierarch</div>
<div class="i1">Of the mystical and dark&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And now, if rightly I do spell</div>
<div class="i1">Of the Lady Christabel,</div>
<div class="i1">She hates the three times ten so white,</div>
<div class="i1">And sickens in their searching light,</div>
<div class="i3">And woe is hers&mdash;alas! alack!</div>
<div class="i3">She hates the three times ten so black&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">As a mastiff bitch doth bark,</div>
<div class="i3">I hear her moaning in the dark!&mdash;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">’Tis the month of January.</div>
<div class="i1">Why lovely maiden, light and airy,</div>
<div class="i1">While the moon can scarcely glow,</div>
<div class="i1">Thro the plumes of falling snow,</div>
<div class="i1">While the moss upon the bark</div>
<div class="i1">Is withered all, and damp, and dark,</div>
<div class="i1">While cold above the stars in doubt</div>
<div class="i1">Look dull, and scarcely will stay out,</div>
<div class="i1">While the snow is heavy on beechen bower</div>
<div class="i1">And hides its name-sake, the snow-drop flower,</div>
<div class="i1">Why walk forth thus mysteriously!</div>
<div class="i1">Dear girl, I ask thee seriously.</div>
<div class="i1">Thy cheek is pale, thy locks are wild&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Ah, think, how big thou art with child!&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Tho’ the baron’s red cloak thro’ the land hath no fellow,</div>
<div class="i1">Thou should’st not thus venture without an umbrella!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">Dost thou wander to the field of graves</div>
<div class="i3">Where the elder its spectral branches waves?</div>
<div class="i3">And will thy hurried footsteps halt</div>
<div class="i3">Where thy mother sleeps in the silent vault?</div>
<div class="i3">Where the stranger pauses long to explore</div>
<div class="i3">The emblems quaint of heraldic lore,</div>
<div class="i3">Where tho’ the lines are tarnished and dim,</div>
<div class="i3">Thy mother’s features stare gaunt and grim,</div>

<div class="i3">Number the beads of thy rosary?</div>
<div class="i3">Nine beads of gold and a tenth of pearl,</div>

<div class="i3">Nine and one, shalt thou record,</div>
<div class="i3">Nine to the virgin and one to the Lord!</div>
<div class="i3">The pearls are ten times one to behold,</div>
<div class="i3">And ten times nine are the beads of gold,</div>
<div class="i3">Methinks ’tis hard of the friar to ask</div>
<div class="i3">On a night like this so weary a task!</div>

<p>The following “wild and singularly original and beautiful
poem” was written at the instigation of Mr. Robert Warren,
who was desirous of enrolling me among the number of his
panegyrists. The circumstances that lead to its original composition
are as follows: I had been considering in what way
I might best introduce the subject, when suddenly falling
asleep over a provincial newspaper which detailed the battle
between Cribb and Molineux, the thoughts of my waking
hours assumed the aspect of the present poetical reverie.
This to an unidead “reading public” may appear incredible,
but minds of imaginative temperament are ever most active
during the intervals of repose, as my late poem, entitled
“The Pains of Sleep,” will sufficiently attest.</p>

<p>Dreams in fact are to be estimated solely in proportion to
their wildness; and hence a friend of mine, who is a most
magnificent dreamer, imagined but the other night that he
invited a flock of sheep to a musical party. Such a <em>flocci</em>,
nauci, nihili absurdity will, I am afraid, puzzle even our
transcendental philosophers to explain, although Kant, in his
treatise on the Phænomena of Dreams, is of opinion that the
lens or focus of intestinal light ascending the æsophagus at
right angles, a juxtaposition of properties takes place, so that
the nucleus of the diaphragm reflecting on the cerebellum the
prismatic visions of the pilorus, is made to produce that marvellous
operation of mind upon matter better known by the
name of dreaming.&mdash;To such <em>simple</em> and <em>satisfactory</em> reasoning
what answer can be made?</p>

<div class="i1">Ten minutes to ten by Saint Dunstan’s clock,</div>
<div class="i1">And the owl has awakened the crowing cock:</div>
<div class="i6">Cock-a-doodle-doo,</div>
<div class="i6">Cock-a-doodle-doo.</div>
<div class="i1">If he crows at this rate in so thrilling a note,</div>

<div class="i1">She barketh her chorus of bow wow, wow:</div>
<div class="i1"><em>Bow</em> for the quarters, and <em>wow</em> for the hour;</div>
<div class="i1">Nought cares she for the sun or the shower;</div>
<div class="i1">But when, like a ghost all-arrayed in its shroud,</div>
<div class="i1">The wheels of the thunder are muffled in cloud,</div>
<div class="i1">When the moon, sole chandelier of night,</div>
<div class="i1">Bathes the blessed earth in light,</div>
<div class="i1">As wizard to wizard, or witch to witch,</div>
<div class="i1">Howleth to heaven this mastiff bitch.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Buried in thought O’Warren lay,</div>
<div class="i1">Like a village queen on the birth of May;</div>
<div class="i1">He listed the tones of Saint Dunstan’s clock,</div>
<div class="i1">Of the mastiff bitch and the crowing cock;</div>
<div class="i1">But louder, far louder, he listed a roar,</div>
<div class="i1">Loud as the billow that booms on the shore;</div>
<div class="i1">Bang, bang, with a pause between,</div>
<div class="i1">Rung the weird sound at his door, I ween.</div>
<div class="i1">Up from his couch he leaped in affright,</div>
<div class="i1">Oped his grey lattice and looked on the night,</div>
<div class="i1">Then put on his coat, and with harlequin hop</div>
<div class="i1">Stood like a phantom in midst of the shop;</div>
<div class="i1">In midst of his shop he stood like a sprite,</div>
<div class="i1">Till peering to left and peering to right,</div>
<div class="i1">Beside his counter, with tail in hand,</div>
<div class="i1">He saw a spirit of darkness stand;</div>
<span class="pageno">132</span>
<div class="i1">I guess ’twas  frightful there to see</div>
<div class="i1">A lady so scantily clad as she</div>
<div class="i1">Ugly and old exceedingly.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">In height her figure was six feet two,</div>
<div class="i1">In breadth exactly two feet six,</div>
<div class="i1">One eye as summer skies was blue,</div>
<div class="i1">The other black as the waves of Styx.</div>
<div class="i1">Her bloodless lips did aught but pair,</div>
<div class="i1">For one was brown and one was fair,</div>
<div class="i1">And clattered like maid in hysteric fit,</div>
<div class="i1">Or jack that turneth a kitchen spit;</div>
<div class="i1">Jesu Maria! with awe, I trow,</div>
<div class="i1">O’Warren beheld this worricow,</div>
<div class="i1">For dreary and dun the death-hue came</div>
<div class="i1">O’er her cheek, as she traced the words of flame;</div>
<div class="i1">The words of flame that with mystic fuss</div>
<div class="i1">Are hatched from a still-born incubus,</div>
<div class="i1">And doom each wight who reads, to dwell</div>
<div class="i1">Till the birth of day in the caves of hell.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Oh! read thee not, read thee not, lord of the Strand,</div>
<div class="i1">The spell that subjects thee to elfin command;</div>
<div class="i2">Vain hope! the bogle hath marked her hour,</div>
<div class="i2">And Warren hath read the words of power;</div>
<div class="i2">Letter by letter he traced the spell,</div>
<div class="i2">Till the sullen toll of Saint Dunstan’s bell,</div>
<div class="i2">And the midnight howl of the mastiff bitch,</div>
<div class="i2">Announced his doom to the Hallowmass witch.</div>
<div class="i2">Still in her grandeur she stood by,</div>
<div class="i2">Like an oak that uplooketh to sun and sky;</div>
<div class="i2">Then shouted to Warren with fitful breath;</div>
<div class="i2">“I’m old mother Nightmare-life-in-death;</div>
<div class="i2">Halloo! halloo! we may not stay,</div>
<div class="i2">Satan is waiting; away, away;</div>
<div class="i2">Halloo! halloo! we’ve far to go,</div>
<div class="i2">Then hey for the devil; jee-up! jee-hoe&mdash;&mdash;”</div>
<div class="i1">O’Warren requested a little delay,</div>
<div class="i1">But the evil one muttered “too late, by my fay;”</div>
<div class="i1">So he put on his breeches and scampered away.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">And here mote I tell how they rode on the wind,</div>
<div class="i1">The witch before and the Warren behind;</div>
<div class="i1">How they passed in a twinkling the haunts of man,</div>
<div class="i1">And the proud pagodas of Kubla Khan;</div>
<div class="i1">How they peeped at the planets like Allan-a-roon,</div>
<div class="i1">And supped on green cheese with the man in the moon;</div>
<div class="i1">Or listed the dulcimer’s tremulous notes,</div>
<div class="i1">Or the voice of the wind through the azure that floats,</div>
<div class="i1">Till pillar and palace and arching sky</div>
<div class="i1">Rung to the mingled melody.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i2">Away, away, through the thunder-cloud,</div>
<div class="i1">Where tempest and ruin sit laughing aloud;</div>
<div class="i1">Away, away, through the fields of air,</div>
<div class="i1">Where the night-wind howls to the falling star;</div>
<div class="i1">This amiable couple have past, and now</div>
<div class="i1">They gain the swart regions of darkness and woe.</div>
<div class="i1">O’Warren beheld them, and shrunk with awe,</div>
<div class="i1">Like a client held fast in the grasp of law,</div>
<div class="i1">Then hymned to the Virgin for aid and for pity,</div>
<div class="i1">A highly correct and devotional ditty:</div>
<div class="i1">“Miserere Maria,” he cried in despair,</div>
<div class="i1">While the bullet-nosed bogle drew back at the prayer,</div>
<div class="i1">For Mary, sweet Mary, hath power to fright,</div>
<div class="i1">And palsy the souls of the dæmons of night;</div>
<div class="i1">“Miserere Maria,” he bellowed again,</div>
<div class="i1">And the worricow dropt her eye-tooth at the strain,</div>
<div class="i1">But spite of her teeth, she eschewed complaint,</div>
<div class="i1">Till troubled in spirit, and cowed and faint,</div>
<div class="i1">She collared the tradesman with horrible yell,</div>
<div class="i1">Then plunged with him head over heels into hell.</div>
<div class="i1">Oh, how its wild waves bellowed and boomed!!</div>
<div class="i1">Oh, how its vapors the air perfumed!!</div>
<div class="i1">As Warren with timid and stifled breath,</div>
<div class="i1">And followed by old Mrs. Life-in-death,</div>
<div class="i1">Moved to where Satan Reclined alone,</div>
<div class="i1">In the silence of thought on his ebon throne.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i2">Proudly he strode to his palace gate,</div>
<div class="i1">Which the witch and the Warren approached in state,</div>
<div class="i1">But paused at the threshold as onward they came,</div>
<div class="i1">And thus, with words of fever and flame,</div>
<div class="i1">The tradesman addressed, “Your name, Sir, is known</div>
<div class="i1">As a vendor of <em>sables</em> wide over the town;</div>
<div class="i1">But in hell with proviso this praise we must mix,</div>
<div class="i1">For though brilliant your blacking, the water of Styx</div>
<div class="i1">Is blacker by far, and can throw, as it suits,</div>
<div class="i1">A handsomer gloss o’er our shoes and our boots.”&mdash;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Answered the Warren, with choleric eye,</div>
<div class="i1">“Oh, king of the cock-tailed incubi!</div>
<div class="i1">The sneer of a fiend to your puffs you may fix,</div>
<div class="i1">But if, what is worse, you assert that your Styx</div>
<div class="i1">Surpasses my blacking, (’twas  clear he was vexed),</div>
<div class="i1">By Jove! you will ne’er stick at any thing next.</div>
<div class="i1">I have dandies who laud me at Paine’s and Almack’s,</div>
<div class="i1">Despite Day and Martin, those emulous quacks,</div>
<div class="i1">And they all in one spirit of concord agree,</div>
<div class="i1">That my blacking is better than any black sea</div>
<div class="i1">Which flows thro’ your paltry Avernus, I wis,”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“Pshaw,” Satan replied, “I’ll be damned if it is.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">The tradesman he laughed at this pitiful sneer,</div>
<div class="i1">And drew from his pocket, unmoved by the jeer</div>
<div class="i1">Of the gathering dæmons, blue, yellow, and pink,</div>
<div class="i1">A bottle of blacking more sable than ink;&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">With the waves of the Styx in a jiffey they tried it,</div>
<div class="i1">But the waves of the <a href="ch5">Styx</a> looked foolish beside it;</div>
<div class="i1">“You mote as well liken the summer sky,”</div>
<div class="i1">Quoth Warren the bold, “with an Irish stye;</div>
<div class="i1">The nightingale’s note with the cockatoo’s whine,</div>
<div class="i1">As your lily-white river with me or mine.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Round the brow of Abaddon fierce anger played</div>
<div class="i1">At the Strand manufacturer’s gasconade;</div>
<div class="i1">And lifting a fist that mote slaughter an ox,</div>
<div class="i1">He wrathfully challenged his foeman to box;</div>
<div class="i2">Then summoned each dæmon to form a ring,</div>
<div class="i2">And witness his truculent triumphing.&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">The ring was formed and the twain set to,</div>
<div class="i1">Like little Puss with Belasco the Jew.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Satan was seconded in a crack,</div>
<div class="i1">By Molineux, the American black,</div>
<div class="i1">(Who sported an oath as a civil Salam),</div>
<div class="i1">While Warren was backed by the ghost of Dutch Sam.&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Gentles, who fondly peruse these lays,</div>
<div class="i1">Wild as a colt o’er the moorland that strays,</div>
<div class="i1">Who thrill at each wondrous rede I tell,</div>
<div class="i1">As fancy roams o’er the floor of hell,</div>
<div class="i1">Now list ye with kindness, the whiles I rehearse</div>
<div class="i1">In shapely pugilistic verse,</div>
<div class="i1">(Albeit my fancy preferreth still</div>
<div class="i1">The quiet of nature,) this desperate <em>Mill</em>.</div>

<div class="poemdivider">THE FIGHT.</div>
<div class="i2">Both men on <em>peeling</em> showed nerve and bone.</div>
<div class="i1">And weighed on an average <em>fourteen stone</em>;</div>
<div class="i1">Doffed their silk <em>fogle</em>, for battle agog,</div>
<div class="i1"><em>Yellowman</em>, <em>castor</em> and white upper <em>tog</em>;</div>
<div class="i1">Then sparred for a second their ardor to cool,</div>
<div class="i1">And rushed at each other like bull to bull.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">ROUNDS.</div>
<div class="i1">1.  Was a <em>smasher</em>, for Brummagem Bob<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_89"

<div class="i2">Let fly a <em>topper</em> on Beelzebub’s <em>nob</em>;</div>
<div class="i2">Then followed him over the ring with ease,</div>
<div class="i2">And <em>doubled him up</em> by a blow in the <em>squeeze</em>.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">2.  Satan was cautious in making play,</div>
<div class="i2">But stuck to his sparring and pummelled away;</div>
<div class="i2">Till the <em>ogles</em> of Warren looked <em>queer</em> in their hue,</div>
<div class="i2">(Here, bets upon Beelzebub; three to two.)</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">3.  <em>Fibbings</em>, and <em>facers</em>, and <em>toppers</em> abound,</div>
<div class="i2">But Satan, it seems, hath the worst of the round.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">4.  Satan was floored by a <em>lunge</em> in the hip,</div>
<div class="i2">And the blood from his peepers, went drip, drip, drip,</div>
<div class="i2">Like fat from a goose in the dripping pan,</div>
<div class="i2">Or ale from the brim of a flowing can;</div>
<div class="i2">His <em>box of dominos</em> chattered aloud,</div>
<div class="i2">(Here, “Go it, Nick!” from an imp in the crowd,)</div>
<div class="i2">And he dropped with a <em>Lancashire purr</em> on his back,</div>
<div class="i2">While Bob with a <em>clincher</em> fell over him, whack.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">5.  Both men <em>piping</em> came up to the <em>scratch</em>,</div>
<div class="i2">But Bob for Abaddon was more than a match;</div>
<div class="i2">He <em>tapped</em> his <em>claret</em>, his mug he rent,</div>
<div class="i2">And made him so <em>groggy</em> with <em>punishment</em>,</div>
<div class="i2">That he gladly gave in at the close of the round,</div>
<div class="i2">And Warren in triumph was led from the ground.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Then trumpet, and timbrel, and deafening shout,</div>
<div class="i1">Like wind through a ruin rang lustily out,</div>
<div class="i1">High o’er the rocks that jut over the deep,</div>
<div class="i1">Where the souls of the damned to eternity weep;</div>
<div class="i1">Echo threw forward her answer of fear,</div>
<div class="i1">Dull as the dust that clanks over a bier,</div>
<div class="i1">Or death-watch that beats in a sick man’s ear.</div>
<div class="i1">From the gulph where they howl to the lead colored night,</div>
<div class="i1">The shadowless spectres leaped up with delight,</div>
<div class="i1">And “Buy Warren’s Blacking” they shouted aloud,</div>
<div class="i1">As the night-wind sighs through a coffinless shroud.</div>
<div class="i1">The evil one frowned while they bellowed amain,</div>
<div class="i1">But “Buy Warren’s Blacking” he chorussed again;</div>
<div class="i1">For tho’ worsted in fight, yet, by order of fate,</div>
<div class="i1">The vanquished must temper the pulse of his hate,</div>
<div class="i1">And yield to the victor (his will’s despite)</div>
<div class="i1">Unbridled sway o’er the fiends of night.</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis done, and sore with his recent thwacking,</div>
<div class="i1">Abaddon hath purchased O’Warren’s Blacking;</div>
<div class="i1">Fate stood by while the bargain was made,</div>
<div class="i1">Signed a receipt when the money was paid,</div>
<div class="i1">Then summoned her sprites, an exemplary band,</div>
<div class="i1">To kneel in respect to the Lord of the Strand.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But hark, ’tis the voice of the crowing cock!</div>
<div class="i1">And hark, ’tis the toll of Saint Dunstan’s clock!</div>
<div class="i1">The morn rides high in the Eastern sky,</div>
<div class="i1">And the little birds carol it merrily:</div>
<div class="i1">Already have waned at the gladsome sight,</div>
<div class="i1">Each scene of darkness, each goblin sprite;</div>
<div class="i1">Abaddon to whit, and the whole of his crew,</div>
<div class="i1">Pink, yellow, or rosy, green, purple, or blue,</div>
<div class="i1">For cheered by the rays thro’ his lattice that peep,</div>
<div class="i1">The bard hath awoke from the “Pains of Sleep.”</div>

<p>This is probably the most amusing parody of <cite>Christabel</cite>
that has ever been written. It appeared originally in
“<cite>Warreniana</cite>,” a small anonymous volume of imitations
published by Longmans &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, in 1824. It is now known
that the author was Mr. W. F. Deacon, who died about
1845.</p>

<p>Between 60 and 70 years ago Robert Warren’s Blacking
was the best advertised article of the day, and even Lord
Byron was accused of writing puffs for it. Hence this
collection of squibs, in which all the leading poets of the
day were represented as singing its praises.</p>

<p>Some few redundant passages have been cut out, but
nothing which is necessary to the plot of the poem has
been omitted. <cite>Warreniana</cite> may still be met with occasionally
as a second-hand book, and is well worth the few
shillings it will cost.</p>

<div class="i1">The Baron has put on his cap and night-gown,</div>
<div class="i1">And with club-stick in hand, has gone in a fright down;</div>
<div class="i1">And there he discovered, oh! think how shocking,</div>
<div class="i1">Bard Bracey alone without shoe or stocking;</div>
<div class="i1">“Bard Bracey, Bard Bracey,” the Baron exclaimed,</div>
<div class="i1">“To remain in this manner, pray arn’t you ashamed?”</div>
<div class="i1">“Bard Bracey, Bard Bracey,” the Baron he cried,</div>
<div class="i1">“Go back, go back, to your own bedside,</div>
<div class="i1">Or with this good cudgel of forest renown,</div>
<div class="i1">As I hope to be saved, I will knock you down.”</div>
<div class="i1">Bard Bracey hath girt up his loins and fled,</div>
<div class="i1">And the Baron eftsoons has gone to bed;</div>
<div class="i1">And a noise is heard, an inscrutable din,</div>
<div class="i1">Of the mastiff without, and the kittens within.</div>
<div class="i1">And the Baron has woke in a hell of a fright,</div>
<div class="i1">And is close to the tinder-box striking a light;</div>
<div class="i1">But in striking the flint with too numerous blows,</div>
<div class="i1">He has missed the tinder, and struck his nose.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">The proud-hearted Baron, o’ercome by the pain,</div>
<div class="i1">Jump’d out of his bed, but finding it vain,</div>
<div class="i1">Altered his mind and jump’d in again:</div>
<div class="i1">And there he dreamt of the father of evil,</div>
<div class="i1">’Ycleft by sinners on earth, the devil;</div>
<div class="i1">But before he could tell what his spirits were at,</div>
<div class="i1">In popp’d father Satan in shape of a cat.</div>
<div class="i1">And he skipp’d thro’ the key-hole with terrible pother,</div>
<div class="i1">A match in one hand, and his tail in the other;</div>
<div class="i1">And said to the Baron, with funeral glee,</div>
<div class="i1">“Come, leap thro’ the window, and fly with me;</div>
<div class="i1">For I’m the mastiff that kick’d up a rout,</div>
<div class="i1">And my broomstick is waiting to carry you out.”</div>
<div class="i1">The Baron requested a little delay;</div>
<div class="i1">But the ill-tempered devil said “Nay, sir, nay;”</div>
<div class="i1">So he put on his breeches and scampered away.</div>
<div class="i1">And here might I tell how they rode on the wind,</div>
<div class="i1">The Baron before, and the devil behind;</div>
<div class="i1">How they rattled along, without food or pelf,</div>
<div class="i1">On the high road to Hell, for I saw them myself.</div>
<div class="i1">How they flew through the clouds like an air baloon.</div>
<div class="i1">And quickly arrived at the hills of the moon.</div>
<div class="i1">How the goddess herself was too late to meet them,</div>
<div class="i1">But sent a committee of moon-calves to greet them;</div>
<div class="i1">How, at five o’clock, just in time for dinner,</div>
<div class="i1">The good-looking couple arrived at the inner</div>
<div class="i1">Abode of hell, where their journey was o’er,</div>
<div class="i1">And they dined off a chop in the Devil’s boudoir;</div>
<div class="i1">All this I could tell, if I wasn’t afraid,</div>
<div class="i1">That Satan would blush for the pranks I betrayed.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">Years have fled since the fatal day,</div>
<div class="i1">When the Baron’s spirit wing’d its way,</div>
<div class="i1">Obsequious at Apollyon’s call,</div>
<div class="i1">To the mansions of death, and the spectral hall;</div>
<div class="i1">But still on that ill-omened hour,</div>
<div class="i1">The death hymn peals and the tempests low’r,</div>
<div class="i1">And knives and forks are laid across,</div>
<div class="i1">And the salt is spill’d to the beldame’s loss;</div>
<div class="i1">And thirteen old women get into the room,</div>
<div class="i1">And the last who goes in&mdash;goes out to the tomb.</div>
<div class="i1">And an ugly thief flies into the candle,</div>
<div class="i1">And pops in your face if you dare it to handle;</div>
<div class="i1">And horrid coffins bounce out of the flame,</div>
<div class="i1">Enough the most desperate courage to tame;</div>
<div class="i1">And demon’s torment the Baron’s soul,</div>
<div class="i1">And sing out exultingly, “Old King Coal;”</div>
<div class="i1">Which proves that the imps and their souls and so forth,</div>
<div class="i1">Are as black as the coals that you buy in the north.</div>
<div class="i1">And legends assert, since this terrible stroke,</div>
<div class="i1">That Bracey still lives like a pig in a poke;</div>
<div class="i1">And my grandmother like to the village chimes,</div>
<div class="i1">Has rung out the subject a hundred times;</div>
<div class="i1">I wist not what the truth may be,</div>

<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">And the worsted night-cap the Baron wore,</div>
<div class="i1">And his flannel hose were seen no more,</div>
<div class="i1">And instead of the pillow as soft as his head,</div>
<div class="i1">A coffin was placed at the foot of the bed;</div>
<div class="i1">And dead men’s bones go dancing about,</div>

<p>This parody, which has more relation to the second part
of <cite>Christabel</cite> than to the first, is taken from “<cite>The Dejeuné</cite>,
or Companion for the Breakfast Table.” Monday, November
6, 1820. <cite>The Dejeuné</cite> was a small paper issued daily at
the price of twopence, by Gold &amp; Northhouse, London, and
afterwards gathered into a volume, which is now very scarce.
After long and patient searching in the British Museum
Library no copy of it could be found, nor was its name, even,
known to the authorities there. But the parody it contained
had been mentioned by authorities on Coleridge, and this
collection would have been incomplete without it, hence
further searching. At last, after all hopes of obtaining it
had departed, the volume was found, in the original boards,
clean, and uncut, amongst waste books and pamphlets outside
a second-hand bookshop.</p>

<p>That the parody is no better is to be regretted, its insertion
here is excusable simply because of its scarcity, for although
the editor of <cite>The Dejeuné</cite> admits that it had already been
printed, he does not mention where, nor has any other copy
of it ever come under our notice.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><cite>The European Magazine and London Review</cite> for April,
1815, contained a poem entitled “<cite>Christobell</cite>, a Gothic tale,”
which was simply a conclusion to Coleridge’s <cite>Christabel</cite>,
although that fact was somewhat artfully veiled in a foot
note, which stated “Written as a sequel to a beautiful
legend of a fair lady and her father, deceived by a witch in
the guise of a noble knight’s daughter.”</p>

<p>It was somewhat ungenerous to steal Coleridge’s metre
and plot upon which to found a poem, without mentioning
the name of the originator. This sequel is anonymous, in
it <cite>Geraldine</cite> is finally discovered to be a witch of the Lake,
and <cite>Merlin</cite> thus addresses her:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">“Witch of the lake, I know thee now!</div>
<div class="i1">Thrice three hundred years are gone</div>
<div class="i3">Since beneath my cave,</div>
<div class="i3">In the western wave,</div>
<div class="i1">I doom’d thee to rue and weep alone,</div>
<div class="i1">And writ thy shame on thy breast and brow.”</div>
<div class="i3">“Thy hour is past, thy spells I sever,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">Witch of the lake descend for ever!”</div>

<p>The most important continuation of Coleridge’s poem was
written by the author of <cite>Proverbial Philosophy</cite>. It was
entitled “<cite>Geraldine</cite>, a sequel to Coleridge’s Christabel,” by
<cite>Martin Farquhar Tupper</cite>. London. Joseph Rickerby.
1838.</p>

<p>In his Preface, Mr. Tupper gives a short prose sketch of
Coleridge’s beautiful but incomplete poem, and remarks that
his excuse for continuing the fragment is to be found in
Coleridge’s own words, “I trust that I shall be able to
embody in verse the three parts yet to come, in the course
of the present year” (1816), a half promise which he never
redeemed.</p>

<p>Mr. Tupper’s poem is in three parts, and is written in
serious imitation of <cite>Christabel</cite>, although he fully admits the
temerity of his attempt to complete Coleridge’s masterpiece.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Another, but very inferior continuation appeared in
<cite>Smallwood’s Magazine</cite>, June 1841 (London. E. Smallwood,
Old Bond Street,) entitled “<cite>Christabel</cite>, continued from
Coleridge,” by Eliza Stewart. There is a total absence of

plot or interest in this poem, and some of the lines descend
to the lowest depths of bathos.</p>

<p>Singularly enough, this poem is immediately followed, in
the magazine, by an Italian ode “To a foggy day in
England,” written by Gabriele Rossetti, father of Dante
Gabriel Rossetti, and William Michael Rossetti.</p>

<p>This brings to mind Mr. T. Hall Caine’s interesting
“<cite>Recollections of Dante Gabriel Rossetti</cite> (London, Elliott
Stock, 1882), in which a chapter is devoted to Rossetti’s
opinions on the Lake poets, and particular prominence is
given to his criticisms on Coleridge, and <cite>Christabel</cite>. First,
the origin of the name is discussed, next the design of the
poem, and whether Coleridge had intended (as some critics
asserted) to show in the sequel that <cite>Geraldine</cite> was not a
disconsolate maiden, but a man bent on the seduction of
<cite>Christabel</cite>.</p>

<p>After these speculations there is an enumeration of
various continuations and parodies of the poem, some mentioned
by Rossetti, others by Mr. Hall Caine.</p>

<p>Unfortunately these references are so vague that it is impossible
to trace some of the articles mentioned.</p>

<p>Thus, it is said the Morning Post <em>about</em> 1820 contained a
continuation of <cite>Christabel</cite>, also that there were parodies in
<cite>The Quarterly</cite>, <cite>The Examiner</cite>, and <cite>The Monthly Magazine</cite>,
but no indication is given of the dates, or volumes, in which
they appeared.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>In 1816 a clever parody was printed in London entitled
“<cite>Christabess, by S. T. Colebritche, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, a right woeful Poem,
translated from the doggerel by Sir Vinegar Sponge</cite>.” 8vo.
Unfortunately no copy of this scarce pamphlet is to be found
in the British Museum Library; it is said to be very funny,
even Coleridge himself quoted it as an admirable parody.
The name of the author of <cite>Christabess</cite> was never divulged.</p>

<p>It is difficult to parody <cite>Christabel</cite> successfully. Even the
attempt contained in <cite>The Poetic Mirror</cite>, although written by
one who was himself a poet, James Hogg, the Ettrick
Shepherd, was an interesting imitation, without invention,
or suitable application of style. It was entitled <cite>Isabelle</cite>, the
same volume contained another imitation of Coleridge’s
style <cite>The Cherub</cite>, which was somewhat more successful, but
neither poem is of sufficient interest to reprint. <cite>The Poetic
Mirror</cite> was published in London in 1816.</p>

<p><cite>Christabel</cite> has also been parodied in German.</p>

<p>“<cite>Chrystabelle; or, the Rose without a Thorn</cite>” is the title
of an extravaganza written by the late Edmund Falconer,
and produced at the Lyceum Theatre, London, December
26, 1860, it does not, however, bear any resemblance to
Coleridge’s poem.</p>

<p>The <cite>City Press</cite> lately reported (April 1888), that the
Tichborne Claimant has returned to this country from
America, travelling under the name of Sir Roger Tichborne,
with Lady Tichborne. His ticket-of-leave is now out, and
he boasts of a determination to re-open the Tichborne case.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">MATTHEW GREGORY LEWIS.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Born</span> 1775.&mdash;<span class="sc">Died May</span> 14, 1818.</p>

<p>The first work of this author that attracted general
attention was a somewhat licentious romance, published
in 1795, entitled <cite>Ambrosio, or the Monk</cite>, from which circumstance
he was afterwards generally styled “Monk Lewis.”
He had a morbid taste for the horrible and supernatural
in literature, and having achieved some fame by his <cite>Monk</cite>
and <cite>Castle Spectre</cite> he continued to write ghost stories till,
following as he did in the wake of Mrs. Radcliffe, he quite
overstocked the market. Upon one occasion Lewis, speaking
to Lady Holland about <cite>The Rejected Addresses</cite>, remarked</p>

<p>“Many of them are very fair, but mine is not at all like;
they have made me write burlesque, which I never do.”
“You don’t know your own talent,” answered the lady.
Lewis was very small in stature, he had large grey eyes,
thick features, and an inexpressive countenance, he was,
however, exceedingly vain, and very foppish in his dress.
But he was a generous, kind hearted man, Sir Walter
Scott spoke highly of him, and Byron wrote</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">“I’d give a world of sugar cane,</div>
<div class="i1">That Mat. Lewis were alive again.”</div>

<p>He was for some time M.P. for Hindon, but he obtained
no parliamentary distinction.</p>

<p>The following, which is his best known poem, first appeared
in his novel <cite>The Monk</cite>:&mdash;</p>

</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="i1">His vizor was clos’d, and gigantic his height,</div>

<div class="i1">All pleasure and laughter were hush’d at his sight,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">His presence all bosoms appear’d to dismay,</div>
<div class="i2">The guests sat in silence and fear;</div>
<div class="i1">At length spoke the bride, while she trembled, “I pray,</div>
<div class="i1">“Sir Knight, that your helmet aside you would lay,</div>
<div class="i2">“And deign to partake of our cheer.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The lady is silent; the stranger complies,</div>
<div class="i2">His vizor he slowly unclos’d;</div>
<div class="i1">Oh! then what a sight met Fair Imogine’s eyes!</div>
<div class="i1">What words can express her dismay and surprise,</div>
<div class="i2">When a skeleton’s head was expos’d!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">All present then utter’d a terrified shout;</div>
<div class="i2">All turn’d with disgust from the scene:</div>
<div class="i1">The worms they crept in, and the worms they crept out,</div>
<div class="i1">And sported his eyes and his temples about,</div>
<div class="i2">While the spectre address’d Imogine:&mdash;</div>

<div class="i1">Thus saying, his arms round the lady he wound,</div>

<p>It is somewhat unusual for an author to parody himself,
but in a volume entitled “<cite>Tales of Wonder</cite>” written and
collected by M. G. Lewis, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, London 1801, he inserted
“Alonzo the Brave,” with a parody written by himself. Of
this, he remarked, that the idea of making an apothecary
of the Knight, and a brewer of the baron, and some few of
the lines, were taken from a parody which appeared in
one of the newspapers under the title of “<cite>Pil-Garlic the
Brave, and Brown Celestine</cite>.”</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that he did not mention the author
of the latter parody, nor the paper in which it originally
appeared.</p>

<div class="i1">They suck’d up the cordial with truest delight:</div>

<div class="i2">Sent some pudding away to be fried!!!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">His wig was turn’d forwards, and short was his height,</div>

<p>The Poems of M. G. Lewis were deemed worthy of imitation
by the authors of <cite>The Rejected Addresses</cite>, and Horace
Smith accordingly wrote one entitled “<cite>Fire and Ale</cite>,” of
which Lord Jeffrey said in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, “Fire
and Ale,” by M. G. Lewis, exhibits not only a faithful copy
of the spirited, loose, and flowing versification of that singular
author, but a very just representation of that mixture of
extravagance and jocularity which has impressed most of his
writings with the character of a sort of farcical horror.”</p>

<div class="i1">From his nostrils a lava sulphureous flows,</div>

<div class="i2">All melted, like butter or bacon!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Oh! then she look’d sour, and indeed well she might,</div>

<p>“<cite>Tales of Wonder</cite>,” written and collected by M. G.
Lewis, contained two ballads entitled “The Erl King”
and “The Cloud King,” both written by Lewis in his
accustomed style of grim horror, with thunder, shrieks,
and fury, and in the same volume he inserted an anonymous
burlesque of these entitled “The Cinder King,”
the humour of which would not be very apparent
unless the two first-named poems were reprinted in
full. They are neither of sufficient interest to merit
the space this would require. A somewhat similar
parody may be found in “<cite>The Blue Bag</cite>: or Toryana.”
London; Effingham Wilson, 1832. It is called “The
Fire King, The Water King, and The Cotton King,” and
relates the quarrels of some politicians, well-known sixty
years since, but now well nigh forgotten.</p>

<p>One more parody of Lewis remains to be noted, it occurs
in an exceedingly scarce volume of poems, “<cite>The School for
Satire</cite>.” London, 1802, and is exceedingly interesting on
account of its allusions to Monk Lewis’s personal appearance,
and his literary productions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="i1">Awoke at midnight with a hearty sneeze,</div>
<div class="i1">And, as he raised himself in bed, he saw</div>

<div class="i1">For, bending in the moon’s uncertain light,</div>

<div class="i1">The sight uncanny made his blood run cold,</div>

<div class="i1">“Behold, I write,” the vision answered then,</div>

<div class="i1">Look through the M’s, but all in vain, I fear,</div>
<div class="i1">You seek your ancient patronymic here.”</div>

<div class="i1">I seldom answer to the public call</div>
<div class="i1">With wants so pressing and with means so small;</div>
<div class="i1">I ply a woodsaw for my bread and pork,</div>

<div class="i1">So, from my purse no stream of largess flows;</div>
<div class="i1">No loud subscription my sign-manual knows;</div>
<div class="i1">But this I do,&mdash;now lend attentive ear&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Each wintry morning when the dawn grows clear,</div>
<div class="i1">I take my bucket to the ash-hole dim,</div>

<div class="i1">She floated towards us from the wreathing crowd</div>
<div class="i1">Of peachey nymphs, and swam a breathing cloud,</div>
<div class="i1">Less with a regulated kind of motion,</div>
<div class="i1">Than like a bird scarring the breast of ocean.</div>
<div class="i1">I thought and said&mdash;“In roseate light she swims,</div>
<div class="i1">Guided, not lifted, by those slopy limbs,</div>
<div class="i1">And wants in air a sister sylph to meet,</div>
<div class="i1">While Earth heaves upward, sick to kiss her feet.”</div>

<div class="i1">But when she ceased that sort of moveless gliding,</div>
<div class="i1">Her gauzy garments round her form subsiding,</div>
<div class="i1">And dashed through all that wonderful display</div>
<div class="i1">Which poet ne’er described, and never may&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">The whirl&mdash;the twist&mdash;the turn&mdash;the start&mdash;the bound,</div>
<div class="i1">The step&mdash;the spring&mdash;the leap&mdash;the fling&mdash;the round;</div>
<div class="i1">The backward bending, and the bold gyration&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">The leg for ages in one situation.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The sparkling, glittering, dazzling, flickering feats</div>
<div class="i1">Which made us jump, delighted, in our seats,</div>
<div class="i1">And then came down, and in child-dalliance pouted,</div>
<div class="i1">While you, and I and everybody shouted,</div>
<div class="i1">And hurled our flowers with vigour almost rude</div>
<div class="i1">(One felt that flowers were such a creature’s food).</div>
<div class="i1">I gave up simile&mdash;it wasn’t easy&mdash;</div>

<span class="sc">LTHOUGH</span> Lord Macaulay’s literary
fame rests principally upon his prose
writings, yet his “<cite>Lays of Ancient
Rome</cite>,” “<cite>Ivry</cite>,” and “<cite>The Armada</cite>,”
are widely popular, and have been frequently
parodied.</p>

<p>“<cite>The Armada</cite>,” (which is but a short fragment)
was first published in 1832, it possesses exceptional
interest at present, as the tercentenary
Commemoration of the defeat of the Spanish
Armada is to be held in Plymouth this year.
Although the natives of Devonshire have most
cause to be proud of the brave deeds of their
ancestors, it must not be forgotten that every
Englishman is now enjoying that religious and
political liberty for which they then fought, the
celebration ought therefore to be a thoroughly
National one.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Those who love English Ballad Poetry will often have
regretted that Lord Macaulay should have left unfinished his
story of the Armada.</p>

<p>His fragment consists of seventy-four lines, bringing the
narrative no further than the night alarm of the approach of
the Spanish fleet. Dr. W. C. Bennett has written a conclusion
of a little over two hundred lines, which can be found
in his “<cite>Contributions to a Ballad History of England</cite>,”
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="pageno">147</span>
(London, Chatto and Windus), whilst another continuation
(in the same metre as the original,) by the Reverend H. C.
Leonard, which originally appeared in <cite>The Boy’s Own Paper</cite>,
has since been published, in pamphlet form, by J. W.
Arrowsmith of Bristol.</p>

<p>By the kind permission of the author, Mr. Leonard’s imitation
is inserted here immediately following Lord Macaulay’s
fragment.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Attend, all ye who list, to hear our noble England’s praise;</div>
<div class="i1">I tell of the thrice-famous deeds she wrought in ancient days,</div>
<div class="i1">When that great fleet invincible against her bore, in vain,</div>
<div class="i1">The richest spoils of Mexico, the stoutest hearts of Spain.</div>
<div class="i1">It was about the lovely close of a warm summer day,</div>
<div class="i1">There came a gallant merchant-ship full sail to Plymouth Bay;</div>
<div class="i1">Her crew hath seen Castile’s black fleet, beyond Aurigny’s isle,</div>
<div class="i1">At earliest twilight, on the waves lie heaving many a mile.</div>
<div class="i1">At sunrise she escaped their van, by God’s especial grace,</div>
<div class="i1">And the tall Pinta, till the noon, had held her close in chase.</div>
<div class="i1">Forthwith a guard at every gun was placed along the wall;</div>
<div class="i1">The beacon blazed upon the roof of Edgcumbe’s lofty hall;</div>
<div class="i1">Many a light fishing-boat put out, to pry along the coast,</div>
<div class="i1">And, with loose rein and bloody spur, rode inland many a post.</div>
<div class="i1">With his white hair unbonneted, the stout old sheriff comes;</div>
<div class="i1">Behind him march the halberdiers; before him sound the drums;</div>
<div class="i1">His yeomen round the market-cross make clear an ample space,</div>
<div class="i1">For there behoves him to set up the standard of Her Grace;</div>
<div class="i1">And haughtily the trumpets peal, and gaily dance the bells,</div>
<div class="i1">As, slow upon the labouring wind, the royal blazon swells.</div>
<div class="i1">Look how the Lion of the sea lifts up his ancient crown,</div>
<div class="i1">And, underneath his deadly paw, treads the gay lillies down!</div>
<div class="i1">So stalked he when he turned to flight, on that famed Picard field,</div>
<div class="i1">Bohemia’s plume, and Genoa’s bow, and Cæsar’s eagle shield.</div>
<div class="i1">So glared he when, at Agincourt, in wrath he turned to bay,</div>
<div class="i1">And, crushed and torn beneath his claws, the princely hunters lay.</div>
<div class="i1">Ho! strike the flagstaff deep, Sir Knight: ho! scatter flowers, fair maids:</div>
<div class="i1">Ho! gunners, fire a loud salute: ho! gallants draw your blades:</div>
<div class="i1">Thou sun, shine on her joyously; ye breezes, waft her wide;</div>
<div class="i1">Our glorious royal battle-flag, the banner of our pride.</div>
<div class="i3">The freshening breeze of eve unfurled that banner’s massy fold;</div>
<div class="i1">The parting gleam of sunshine kissed that haughty scroll of gold;</div>
<div class="i1">Night sank upon the dusky beach, and on the purple sea,</div>
<div class="i1">Such night in England ne’er had been, nor e’er again shall be!</div>
<div class="i1">From Eddystone to Berwick bounds, from Lynn to Milford Bay,</div>
<div class="i1">That time of slumber was as bright and busy as the day;</div>
<div class="i1">For swift to east and swift to west the ghastly war-flame spread,</div>
<div class="i1">High on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount it shone: it shone on Beachy Head.</div>
<div class="i1">Far on the deep the Spaniard saw, along each southern shire,</div>
<div class="i1">Cape beyond cape, in endless range, those twinkling points of fire.</div>
<div class="i1">The fisher left his skiff to rock on Tamar’s glittering waves:</div>
<div class="i1">The rugged miners poured to war from Mendip’s sunless caves;</div>
<div class="i1">O’er Longleat’s towers, o’er Cranbourne’s oaks, the fiery herald flew:</div>
<div class="i1">He roused the shepherd of Stonehenge, the rangers of Beaulieu.</div>
<div class="i1">Right sharp and quick the bells all night rang out from Bristol town,</div>
<div class="i1">And, ere the day, three hundred horse had met on Clifton Down;</div>
<div class="i1">The sentinel on Whitehall gate looked forth into the night,</div>
<div class="i1">And saw, o’erhanging Richmond Hill, the streak of blood red light.</div>
<div class="i1">Then bugle’s note and cannon’s roar, the death-like silence broke,</div>
<div class="i1">And with one start, and with one cry, the royal city woke.</div>
<div class="i1">At once, on all her stately gates, arose the answering fires;</div>
<div class="i1">At once the wild alarum clashed from all her reeling spires;</div>
<div class="i1">From all the batteries of the Tower pealed loud the voice of fear,</div>
<div class="i1">And all the thousand masts of Thames sent back a louder cheer:</div>
<div class="i1">And, from the furthest wards, was heard the rush of hurrying feet,</div>
<div class="i1">And the broad streams of pikes and flags rushed down each roaring street;</div>
<div class="i1">And broader still became the blaze, and louder still the din,</div>
<div class="i1">As, fast from every village round, the horse came spurring in:</div>
<div class="i1">And eastward straight from wild Blackheath the warlike errand went,</div>
<div class="i1">And roused, in many an ancient hall, the gallant squires of Kent;</div>
<div class="i1">Southward from Surrey’s pleasant hills flew those bright couriers forth;</div>
<div class="i1">High on bleak Hampstead’s swarthy moor they started for the north;</div>
<div class="i1">And on, and on, without a pause, untired they bounded still:</div>
<div class="i1">All night, from town to town, they sprang; they sprang from hill to hill:</div>
<div class="i1">Till the proud peak unfurled the flag o’er Darwins rocky dales;</div>
<div class="i1">Till, like volcanoes, flared to heaven the stormy hills of Wales;</div>
<div class="i1">Till twelve fair counties saw the blaze on Malvern’s lonely Height;</div>
<div class="i1">Till streamed in crimson on the wind the Wrekin’s crest of light;</div>
<div class="i1">Till, broad and fierce, the star came forth on Ely’s stately fane,</div>
<div class="i1">And tower and hamlet rose in arms, o’er all the boundless plain;</div>
<div class="i1">Till Belvoir’s lordly terraces the sign to Lincoln sent,</div>
<div class="i1">And Lincoln sped the message on, o’er the wild vale of Trent;</div>
<div class="i1">Till Skiddaw saw the fire that burned on Gaunt’s embattled pile,</div>
<div class="i1">And the red glare on Skiddaw roused the burghers of Carlisle;</div>
<div class="poemdivider">(<span class="decoration">End of Lord Macaulay.</span>)</div>
<div class="i1">Till, from the peaks of Cheviot, the wonder-telling flames</div>
<div class="i1">Passed on the news from Berwick bounds to subjects of King James.</div>
<span class="pageno">148</span>
<div class="i3">O well it was for Englishmen that, as the tidings spread,</div>
<div class="i1">No panic seized their stalwart hearts, no fear or craven dread.</div>
<div class="i1">O well it was for England then that, on her trial day,</div>
<div class="i1">Her sailors and her soldiers brave were ready, ready aye!</div>
<div class="i1">And Catholics and Protestants with equal zeal were seen</div>
<div class="i1">Vying who best could England serve, who best could serve the Queen.</div>
<div class="i3">Lord Effingham had chief command in Plymouth Sound that day,</div>
<div class="i1">Hawkins and Drake and Frobisher like hounds in leashes lay;</div>
<div class="i1">Drake and his men were playing bowls that eve, on Plymouth Hoe,</div>
<div class="i1">Said he, “My mates, we’ll end our game and then we’ll end the foe!”</div>
<div class="i1">When scarce the morning light had broke on land and sea around</div>
<div class="i1">The English fleet, of forty sail, put out from Plymouth Sound;</div>
<div class="i1">The flagship was the Raleigh Ark; beside her sailed the Bear,</div>
<div class="i1">The Dreadnought and the Victory had foremost places there;</div>
<div class="i1">And soon they saw the Spanish ships, with every sail outspread,</div>
<div class="i1">Come up from the Atlantic main, by the tall Pinta led;</div>
<div class="i1">Full six-score gallant ships sailed up, the south-west wind before,</div>
<div class="i1">And, like a crescent moon, they stretched for seven good miles or more,</div>
<div class="i1">And on their decks and in their hulls were thirty thousand men.</div>
<div class="i1">Such fleet was never seen before, nor shall be seen again!</div>
<div class="i1">Up channel now they set their helms, King Philip ordered so,</div>
<div class="i1">To join the Duke of Parma’s men, ere up the Thames they go!</div>
<div class="i1">For he, the greatest general that Spain or Europe knew,</div>
<div class="i1">In Flanders long had waited them, and now impatient grew.</div>
<div class="i1">But well the little English ships hung on their rear that day,</div>
<div class="i1">And many a shot and shell flew east, to speed the Spaniard’s way!</div>
<div class="i1">See hindermost, with towering poop, a galleon of Biscay</div>
<div class="i1">Laden with gold of Mexico, full thirty weeks of pay;</div>
<div class="i1">And next a frigate huge sails up, with port-holes open wide,</div>
<div class="i1">From Andalusia is she come with piles of arms inside.</div>
<div class="i1">But well for England fought that day the flame and southwest wind!</div>
<div class="i1">The devil takes, the proverb says, the one that comes behind!</div>
<div class="i1">The Andalusian lost her mast, the treasure barque took fire,</div>
<div class="i1">While, in their wake, the English ships pressed ever nigh and nigher,</div>
<div class="i1">And ere had paled, that summer night, the sunset’s ruddy glow</div>
<div class="i1">These two, with all the spoil, were towed right up to Plymouth Hoe.</div>
<div class="i1">Brave Drake it was that took the gold, but not a coin kept he;</div>
<div class="i1">Full fifty thousand to his men he dealt, with jovial glee!</div>
<div class="i3">Beyond the Tamar Raleigh lay, the Lizard Head to guard,</div>
<div class="i1">But, when he saw the Spaniards pass, said he, “I count it hard</div>
<div class="i1">That I who came to lead the van thus in the rear should lag!”</div>
<div class="i1">He left his men, took horse and rode, and joined the Admiral’s flag!</div>
<div class="i1">And now from every western port the ships came more and more,</div>
<div class="i1">From Bristol and from Barnstaple, from all along the shore;</div>
<div class="i1">From Dartmouth and from Bridport town, from Weymouth, Poole, and Lyme,</div>
<div class="i1">And every ship spread all her sail, in haste to be in time.</div>
<div class="i3">’Twas off the point of Portland Bill the first great fight took place;</div>
<div class="i1">The year was fifteen-eighty-eight, of our Redeemer’s grace,</div>
<div class="i1">Throughout a glorious summer day, July the twenty-third,</div>
<div class="i1">A cannonade both fierce and loud on either coast was heard.</div>
<div class="i1">The hulking Spanish galleons then were sorely put about,</div>
<div class="i1">The English ships sailed out and in, sailed briskly in and out.</div>
<div class="i1">As when a mighty baited bull the valiant dogs surround,</div>
<div class="i1">And all his bulk and all his strength of little use are found,</div>
<div class="i1">So many a great three-decker then threw wide her shot and shell;</div>
<div class="i1">The balls flew o’er the English masts, and in the billows fell!</div>
<div class="i1">But now the light and gunpowder alike were spent and gone,</div>
<div class="i1">And, in the night, the Spanish fleet their eastward way went on.</div>
<div class="i1">In Calais roads the foemen next their anchors huge let fall,</div>
<div class="i1">And to the Duke of Parma then they sent an urgent call:</div>
<div class="i1">“Send out your pinnaces in haste, your boats with all dispatch;</div>
<div class="i1">To fight these English devils thus is not an equal match!”</div>
<div class="i1">But to this plan the Hollanders, old England’s staunch Ally,</div>
<div class="i1">Refused consent, and would not let the pinnaces pass by.</div>
<div class="i1">At length the Spaniards spread their sails and took their onward way</div>
<div class="i1">Till off the Flemish coast, becalmed, the great Armada lay;</div>
<div class="i1">And still the gallant English ships kept up with their advance</div>
<div class="i1">Till six-score sail around them lay, and waited for their chance.</div>
<div class="i3">Meanwhile on land, Her Grace’s troops, as active as the fleet,</div>
<div class="i1">Prepared themselves with urgent haste the foreign foe to meet.</div>
<div class="i1">Ten thousand Londoners in arms rallied around the Queen,</div>
<div class="i1">A hundred thousand, hastening up from every shire, were seen;</div>
<div class="i1">And as they came they leapt and danced and sang, with cheerfull face,</div>
<div class="i1">As nimble runners gird their loins, with joy to run a race.</div>
<div class="i1">At Tilbury Fort Elizabeth reviewed the bright array:</div>
<div class="i1">O long did loyal English hearts recall that famous day!</div>
<div class="i1">And long shall grateful Englishmen, that know her faults no less,</div>
<div class="i1">Revere the gallant memory of England’s Good Queen Bess;</div>
<div class="i1">For, riding on her war-horse white, the serried ranks between,</div>
<div class="i1">A noble sight it was to see Old England’s Virgin Queen!</div>
<div class="i1">A helmet crowned her golden hair, and they that saw it tell</div>
<div class="i1">No coronet of diamonds became Her Grace so well;</div>
<div class="i1">A coat of mail of burnished steel the Royal Maiden wore,</div>
<div class="i1">And, in her fair white hand, aloft a truncheon-sceptre bore;</div>
<div class="i1">Then up she spoke, and reined her steed before the troops to stand,</div>
<div class="i1">And all could hear her accents clear beside the Essex strand:</div>
<div class="i1">“My loving friends, my courtiers say I run a risk this morn,</div>
<div class="i1">That treason lurks in martial throngs! Their cautious speech I scorn!</div>
<div class="i1">For rather than distrust you all, from life I’d sooner part:</div>
<div class="i1">Let tyrants fear! Next to my God I trust my people’s heart:</div>
<div class="i1">So come I in your midst to-day, the Spaniards to defy,</div>
<div class="i1">And for my God, and for my lands, with you to live or die.</div>
<div class="i1">But well I know my frame is weak; what can a woman do?</div>
<div class="i1">Yet mine’s the spirit of a king, a king of England too!</div>
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pageno">149</span>
<div class="i1">Full scorn I think that any King, or any prince on earth,</div>
<div class="i1">Should dare to set his foot within the land that gave us birth!</div>
<div class="i1">So I will be your general, and mark each gallant deed,</div>
<div class="i1">And to the victors in the fight give each their fitting meed</div>
<div class="i1">So o’er the enemies of my God, and of this nation free,</div>
<div class="i1">The valour of your arms shall win a famous victory!”</div>
<div class="i3">But now my Lord of Effingham had made his cautious plan,</div>
<div class="i1">And in the night, off Dunkirk coast, a fearful fight began;</div>
<div class="i1">At close of day uprose the tide, uprose a gale of wind,</div>
<div class="i1">And, on its wings, eight fire-ships flew the Spanish fleet behind;</div>
<div class="i1">With sulphur and with rosin filled, their hulls were all aflame.</div>
<div class="i1">And right upon the foemen’s ships, the fiery terror came;</div>
<div class="i1">The Spaniards then their anchors weighed, and some their cables threw,</div>
<div class="i1">In aimless course before the wind the ponderous galleons flew.</div>
<div class="i1">The morrow morn the English took full many a splendid prize,</div>
<div class="i1">While some, hard hit, by shot and shell, went down before eyes.</div>
<div class="i1">Some foul of one another fell, in Flemish shallows lost;</div>
<div class="i1">The rest flew north before the gale, to round the Scottish coast.</div>
<div class="i1">Ah! better had they yielded then, or waited for their time,</div>
<div class="i1">Till change of wind might speed their course back to their southern clime;</div>
<div class="i1">For, up beyond the Orkney Isles, a furious tempest roared,</div>
<div class="i1">And many a gallant ship was lost with every soul on board.</div>
<div class="i1">And, on the iron northern coast, vast hosts of valiant men</div>
<div class="i1">Were wrecked, or drowned, or butchered there, and never saw again</div>
<div class="i1">The southern sun, the orange groves, the smiling Spanish shore,</div>
<div class="i1">Which, full of pride and hope, they left but three short months before;</div>
<div class="i1">And only sixty ships came back, into Santander bay,</div>
<div class="i1">Of all the host that once had sailed to take their northern way.</div>
<div class="i1">And, ah! how changed the gallant fleet, how changed the ragged forms</div>
<div class="i1">Alike of ships and men, sore marred by cruel seas and storms!</div>
<div class="i1">All splintered were the masts and yards, the bowsprits shot away,</div>
<div class="i1">The sails to ribbons torn, the men all fevered, gaunt and gray!</div>
<div class="i3">But in old England swells the sound of mirth and joy and praise,</div>
<div class="i1">By day triumphal banners wave, by night the bonfires blaze,</div>
<div class="i1">The church-bells’ merry carillon, the cannon’s harmless roar,</div>
<div class="i1">Are echoed loud from shire to shire, resound from shore to shore.</div>
<div class="i1">At Whitehall now the Virgin Queen, on the appointed day,</div>
<div class="i1">In grand procession takes her place amidst the crowded way.</div>
<div class="i1">See, on her right, great Cecil rides: a wiser man than he</div>
<div class="i1">Ne’er led our glorious country on to meet his destiny:</div>
<div class="i1">And, on her left, in manhood’s prime, is Raleigh proud and brave,</div>
<div class="i1">Back from Virginia lately come, across the Atlantic Wave.</div>
<div class="i1">Lords Effingham and Seymour next move onward side by side,</div>
<div class="i1">Hawkins and Drake and Frobisher but just behind them ride;</div>
<div class="i1">Lord Oxford and Lord Cumberland, and Vavasor and Blount,</div>
<div class="i1">And more of England’s chiefest men, too numerous to recount.</div>
<div class="i1">From every window beauty smiles, in faces young and old,</div>
<div class="i1">And all the streets and all the roofs are wondrous to behold:</div>
<div class="i1">Like bees they swarm! From every nook and corner of the land</div>
<div class="i1">They haste to render thanks to God for His delivering hand.</div>
<div class="i1">In all the way the densest throng at Ludgate Hill is seen,</div>
<div class="i1">For there the player-men have wrought a wondrous arch of green;</div>
<div class="i1">With them a youth of forehead high and eyes that pierce like flame;</div>
<div class="i1">Mark well his face, ye passers-by, for Shakespeare is his name!</div>
<div class="i1">So to Saint Paul’s they come, and when they reach the western door</div>
<div class="i1">Her grace the stately chariot leaves, and kneels upon the floor.</div>
<div class="i1">And, as a solemn silence falls upon the surging crowd,</div>
<div class="i1">Her queenly voice gives thanks for all, in accents clear and loud.</div>
<div class="i1">Three hundred years have passed since then, and many a change is seen;</div>
<div class="i1">But, God save England! still we cry, and God save England’s Queen!</div>

<div class="i1">Attend, all ye who wish to hear our noble London’s praise,</div>
<div class="i1">I sing of that great Tuesday night that saw her in a blaze,</div>
<div class="i1">When the Archbishop’s benison had linked, in bridal chain,</div>
<div class="i1">Young Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, and our sweet bright-eyed Dane.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">It was about the chilly close of a half-foggy day,</div>
<div class="i1">When London’s myriads all came out to see the grand display;</div>
<div class="i1">From sleepy Hammersmith, and from the Dog’s amphibious Isle,</div>
<div class="i1">The east and west they poured along for many a muddy mile.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The aristocracy for once the pageant deigned to grace,</div>
<div class="i1">(Except a few who fled from town, and joined the sylvan chace).</div>
<div class="i1">Each wide-awake and travelling cap was taken from the wall,</div>
<div class="i1">Each wrap and bearskin was brought down and ready in the hall,</div>
<div class="i1">Many a gay visitor came up from province and from coast,</div>
<div class="i1">And on that night Sir Rowland Hill, he stopped the local post.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">See, mounted on his charger tall, the proud Inspector comes,</div>
<div class="i1">For sterner work than aiding swells to get to balls and drums,</div>
<div class="i1">His constables essay to clear in every street a space,</div>
<div class="i1">And shout his orders with much more of Henergy than grace;</div>
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pageno">150</span>
<div class="i1">And haughtily the dandies sneer, and slightly scream the belles,</div>
<div class="i1">As round the crested carriage the plebeian torrent swells,</div>

<div class="i1">To bribe his way from streets his coach should never have gone down.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">The rain is done, each carriage ope, and each umbrella fold,</div>
<div class="i1">And now to see how London shines as bright as molten gold.</div>
<div class="i1">Night sinks upon that multitude, that roaring surging sea,</div>
<div class="i1">Night that in London never was and ne’er again shall be.</div>
<div class="i1">From Westminster to Islington, from Lord’s to Ratcliffe Way,</div>
<div class="i1">That time of slumber is as bright and busy as the day:</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For swift to East and swift to West the glaring joy-flame spread.</div>
<div class="i1">High on Victoria tower it shone, on the New River Head,</div>
<div class="i1">In pleasant Kent, in Essex dull, and each surrounding shire</div>
<div class="i1">The semi-bumpkins gaped and grinned to mark each point of fire.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">The huge sea-lanterns dimly showed on Wren’s cathedral height,</div>
<div class="i1">But Science rather made a mull with her electric light,</div>
<div class="i1">The Templars, for their brother Prince, lit up their dingy fane,</div>
<div class="i1">And you could see their Lamb and Flag made out uncommon plain.</div>
<div class="i1">Rich was the glare that Mappin’s house (the cab pervader) sent,</div>
<div class="i1">Fierce glowed the Store that sells the beer from Burton-upon-Trent.</div>
<div class="i1">And many a hundred grease-pots did their best for Barry’s pile,</div>

<div class="poemdivider"><cite>First Prize.</cite></div>
<div class="i1">Hearken, all ye who care to hear my panoramic lay;</div>
<div class="i1">I sing of that resplendent Show I saw last Lord Mayor’s Day,</div>
<div class="i1">When forth from “famous London town” to grace their chosen lord</div>
<div class="i1">Came shields and banners of each Guild, and men of every Ward.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">It was about the gloomy noon of a dull November day,</div>
<div class="i1">When from the stately Guildhall’s court set out this pageant gay;</div>
<div class="i1">The crowds, who long had waited, cheered to see it slowly file</div>
<div class="i1">Down King-street and across Cheapside come winding near a mile.</div>
<div class="i1">Forthwith the bells of every church chimed all the “bobs” they knew,</div>
<div class="i1">While mounted “bobbies” led the way that they might clear it too.</div>
<div class="i1">Next these appear the Fire Brigade, with engines fully manned,</div>
<div class="i1">For here behoved that they should march ’twixt men of sea and land&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">’Twixt sailor and ’twixt soldier placed, as though between two fires,</div>
<div class="i1">Whose ardent spirits they might quench if aught should rouse their ires;</div>
<div class="i1">So Guards and Rifles in their front played stirring tunes of war,</div>
<div class="i1">While merrily behind them marched full many a youthful tar.</div>
<div class="i1">And next on prancing palfreys borne, with plume and nodding crest,</div>
<div class="i1">Four gallant knights with lances come, in silver armour drest;</div>
<div class="i1">Look how their war-steeds gracefully lift up their well-trained feet,</div>
<div class="i1">While underneath their iron hoofs resounds the stony street;</div>
<div class="i1">So stamp they when at Sanger’s Cirque, in Bosworth’s mimic fight,</div>
<div class="i1">They Richmond or brave Surrey bear, or some great mail-clad knight.</div>
<div class="i1">How can one human pen suffice to paint this varying Show,</div>
<div class="i1">Where Watermen with standards gay in long procession flow?</div>
<div class="i1">Where Lancers, true to Bacchus, the monarch of the vine,</div>
<div class="i1">Escort the mighty Vintners with band and strains divine;</div>
<div class="i1">Where proudly the “Swan-hoppers” bear the banners of the Guild,</div>
<div class="i1">With master and with wardens comes many a carriage filled;</div>
<div class="i1">While onwards without ceasing stream more banners, knights, and bands,</div>
<div class="i1">And louder still the people cheer, still louder clap their hands.</div>
<div class="i1">Ho, guildsmen, all your banners wave! ho, gaily ring, ye bells!</div>
<div class="i1">Ho, trumpets, sound a flourish! ho, urchins, shriek your yells!</div>
<div class="i1">Thou coachman, drive on furiously; ye horses swiftly stride;</div>
<div class="i1">Speed on that glorious coach which bears our Lord Mayor in his pride.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">No sun shone on those panels decked with classic subjects old;</div>
<div class="i1">The mists of damp November dimmed its hammercloth of gold;</div>
<div class="i1">Still boys at its great Jehu stared, and their tears began to flow,</div>
<div class="i1">To think such coach they ne’er would see until next Lord Mayor’s Show.</div>
<div class="i1">From the Guildhall to Westminster, whene’er that pageant passed,</div>
<div class="i1">The tide of business there was slow, as on a day of fast;</div>
<div class="i1">Girls rushed to doors and windows, men climbed on gates and walls,</div>
<div class="i1">Right loud and clear the bells all day rang out from great <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s;</div>
<div class="i1">The sentinel on Whitehall Gate looked neither left nor right,</div>
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pageno">151</span>
<div class="i1">But as he looked straight to his front he must have seen the sight.</div>
<div class="i1">At Westminster it paused, and then down Thames Embankment wound,</div>
<div class="i1">While thicker still became the throng, and louder still the sound,</div>
<div class="i1">Till, Guildhall reached, it halted, while the Mayor in state descends</div>
<div class="i1">To greet and feast great Beaconsfield, to banquet with his friends.</div>
<div class="i1">As grand as was the Show this year, so may it next year be;</div>
<div class="i1">Heaven send us such another sight, and take me there to see.</div>

<div class="i1">I’ll tell you of the Lord Mayor’s Show I saw long years ago;</div>
<div class="i1">What time the gallant ’prentice band came forth with gibe and jeer</div>
<div class="i1">To flout the civic monarch whom they had been used to cheer.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">It was a fine November day, the year of the Zulu war,</div>

<div class="i1">Preceded by the minstrelsy of all the Life Guards band;</div>
<div class="i1">He’d dodged beneath a horse, and ’scaped by dint of nimble feet,</div>
<div class="i1">Though a peeler tall, B 99, had chased him down the street.</div>
<div class="i1">Straightway each clerk and office boy his walnuts ceased to crack,</div>
<div class="i1">Forth from its hiding place was brought a hideous doll dyed black;</div>
<div class="i1">The dirty little boys ran out the soldiers to espy,</div>
<div class="i1">While in the crowd the pickpockets were faking many a cly.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">From Westminster and Whitechapel, from Shoreditch and Vauxhall,</div>
<div class="i1">The idle vagrants had turned out with laughter and catcall;</div>
<div class="i1">From east to west the show moved on, and still the hooting spread,</div>
<div class="i1">It thundered through Trafalgar-square where Nelson rears his head;</div>
<div class="i1">From Whitehall’s topmost story the Treasury clerk might hear</div>
<div class="i1">Street after street re-echoing the oft-repeated jeer;</div>
<div class="i1">The coster left his barrow-load, careless of urchin raids;</div>
<div class="i1">The dapper waiters hurried forth from restaurants and shades.</div>
<div class="i1">All down the street of Parliament th’ assembled loafers bawl,</div>
<div class="i1">And rouse the warders of Millbank, the Judges in their Hall;</div>
<div class="i1">Right merrily with eager pen the specials took it down,</div>
<div class="i1">And forty counties learned next day the humours of the town.</div>

<div class="i1">They held a council standing</div>
<div class="i2">Before the River-Gate;</div>
<div class="i1">Short time was there, ye well may guess,</div>
<div class="i2">For musing or debate.</div>
<div class="i1">Outspake the Consul roundly:</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">Marcus Curtius, the Honest Lawyer.</span></div>
<div class="poemdivider">(<span class="decoration">A Lay of Ancient Rome.</span>)</div>
<div class="i1">Wilt hear how Marcus Curtius, that lawyer true and hold,</div>
<div class="i1">Did bravely for his country in the brave days of old?</div>
<div class="i1">How by Justinian’s Institutes and his green baize bag he swore,</div>
<div class="i1">That the only honest lawyer could live in Rome no more?</div>
<div class="i1">Oh, none could be more honest in life and death, than he</div>
<div class="i1">Who cheated but the sexton, and saved the burial fee.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The lawyers in the Forum are squabbling loud and long,</div>
<div class="i1">To the wonder of their clients, confounding right and wrong;</div>
<div class="i1">Begowned, bewigged, bewildered, each judge the clamour hears,</div>
<div class="i1">And Justice, blind already, would fain have stopped her ears.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">As now the wordy contest grew hotter still and hotter,</div>
<div class="i1">The desks, the books, the benches, began to quake and totter;</div>
<div class="i1">And they heard a sound like thunder, a horrid, dreary sound,</div>
<div class="i1">As though all the powers of evil danced the polka underground.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The lawyers through their spectacles looked with a stony glare,</div>
<div class="i1">And the crier stammered out, “O Yes,” and whispered through a prayer:</div>
<div class="i1">Some of the judges fainted, and there for dead they lay;</div>
<div class="i1">And the jury snatched their solidi, and fleetly ran away.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And now&mdash;O, sight of wonder!&mdash;with a stifling smell of sulph-</div>
<div class="i1">Er, in the Middle Forum, there gaped a hideous gulf:</div>
<div class="i1">A gulf as black as midnight, or “best Japan,” I trow;</div>
<div class="i1">And a voice came howling, hissing up, like a thousand whirlwinds now:</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“This gulf will close&mdash;no, never! till in Rome the rarest thing,</div>
<div class="i1">The rarest and most wondrous, a sacrifice you bring.”</div>
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pageno">155</span>
<div class="i1">O! great was the lamenting, when these fearful facts were known,</div>
<div class="i1">The mothers weep and wring their hands, the grandames groan “Ochone;”</div>
<div class="i1">And the little boys no longer their flying hoops pursue,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor chaunt of “Ole Virginny,” as they were wont to do.</div>
<div class="i1">And the men in moody silence pace slowly to and fro,</div>
<div class="i1">With pallid lip, and frowning brow, and countenance of woe;</div>
<div class="i1">And the Fathers of the City&mdash;the Aldermen and Mayor&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Are met in solemn council, with a grave and puzzled air.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then uprises Lucius Cimber, a grocer proud was he,</div>
<div class="i1">Who traded first with China, in Twankay and Bohea;</div>
<div class="i1">And in accents slow and solemn, thus the meeting he advised:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“Let’s try and fill the hole up with stones macadamised.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And they listened to his counsel, and with shovel and with spade,</div>
<div class="i1">They adjourned unto the Forum, and aside their togas laid.</div>
<div class="i1">And then all in their shirt sleeves they worked with might and main,</div>
<div class="i1">Patrician and Plebeian, alike they worked in vain.</div>
<div class="i1">For though a thousand cart-loads into the gulf they threw,</div>
<div class="i1">Instead of getting shallower it deep and deeper grew.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And now a frenzied client who had lost his all that day,</div>
<div class="i1">Seized “Selwyn’s Nisi Prius” from the bookshelf where it lay,</div>
<div class="i1">And in the hole he dashed it, with a howl of maniac glee,</div>
<div class="i1">And wished all law and lawyers at the bottom of the sea.</div>
<div class="i1">And, fired by his example, the crowd seized, one by one,</div>
<div class="i1">On “Chitty,” and on “Starkey,” and on “Coke and Lyttleton”</div>
<div class="i1">On Bacon’s Whole Abridgement, with tooth and nail they fell,</div>
<div class="i1">But where they wished those authors, ’twere not polite to tell.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">In vain the poor librarian, while tears ran down his cheek,</div>
<div class="i1">Strove to bend them from their purpose&mdash;not a word they’d hear him speak.</div>
<div class="i1">And the venerable Chief Justice, like Lord Mansfield at the fire,</div>
<div class="i1">Not caring to remonstrate, thought it prudent to retire.</div>
<div class="i1">So they rifled all the library of every book they saw,</div>
<div class="i1">Yet the gulf but yawned the wider for all that dose of law.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then from that mixed assembly a seedy-looking gent</div>
<div class="i1">(He pays not much for mending who cannot pay his <em>rent</em>),</div>
<div class="i1">With an old coat all in tatters, and a hat without a brim,</div>
<div class="i1">Stalked proudly from the multitude, who, curious, gazed on him.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“My name is Marcus Curtius! a Roman knight am I,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And eke a learned counsellor, but, alas! I cannot lie!</div>
<div class="i1">I’ve gone upon the Circuit,&mdash;there came no briefs to me;</div>
<div class="i1">I ne’er addressed a jury, ne’er pocketed a fee.</div>
<div class="i1">Alas! mistaken parents, to bind me to the law!</div>
<div class="i1">I have no natural cunning to make or find a flaw.</div>
<div class="i1">He who’d sit upon a woolsack must be ne’er with conscience cursed,</div>
<div class="i1">And, for <em>wool</em> to fill the cushion, he must take to <em>fleecing</em> first.</div>
<div class="i1">Then behold in me, O Romans! what the oracle demands,</div>
<div class="i1">The thing in Rome that’s rarest, a lawyer with clean hands.</div>
<div class="i1">A truly honest lawyer, with a feeling, tender soul,</div>
<div class="i1">Which, witness this nay garment&mdash;a tongue’s in ev’ry hole.</div>
<div class="i1">For the good of thee, my country, I die a true-blue Tory,</div>
<div class="i1">For <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dulce et decorum, est pro patria mori</i>!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He said, and on the lawyers he turned a kindling eye,</div>
<div class="i1">As away on all sides slinking, no one dared make reply.</div>
<div class="i1">Then smiling sad but calmly, he cried “Good Charon, hark!</div>
<div class="i1">I’m too poor to pay the obolus for crossing in your bark,</div>
<div class="i1">But I know that you will trust me; so now, my friends, good bye,</div>
<div class="i1">I’ll trouble not the coroner, a natural death I die:</div>
<div class="i1">A natural death for Curtius, who might have been so rich,</div>
<div class="i1">But he was an <em>honest</em> lawyer, so he perished in a ditch.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He said, and threw a summersault into that dreary <span class="lock">vat&mdash;</span></div>
<div class="i1">Head foremost, like a thunder-bolt down went the brimless hat;</div>
<div class="i1">Down went the brimless beaver, fall many a fathom deep,</div>
<div class="i1">And the women took hysterics, and the men began to weep.</div>
<div class="i1">When they dashed away the tear drops, and looked ahead again,</div>
<div class="i1">Where that gulf had late been yawning, there lay a level plain.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And they reared a marble tombstone on the spot where he had died,</div>
<div class="i1">And in letters carved and gilded, was inscribed on either side</div>
<div class="poemcenter"><b>Here Marcus Curtius lyes,</b></div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Round turn’d he somewhat stagger’d,</div>
<div class="i2">These myrmidons to see,</div>
<div class="i1">But he took the watchman’s measure,</div>
<div class="i2">And the weight of “Twenty-three.”</div>
<div class="i1">And ere “Robinson” you’d summon</div>
<div class="i2">He had laid the former low,</div>
<div class="i1">By tripping up his heels, and dealt</div>
<div class="i1">To “Twenty-three” (above the belt)</div>
<div class="i2">A firm left handed blow.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Bereft of speech and breathing,</div>

<div class="i1">Who bought his love with viands rare,</div>
<div class="i2">Of habit full was he);</div>
<div class="i1">And Johnson, by his valour</div>
<div class="i2">Freed from judicial grab,</div>
<div class="i1">In safety gain’d the neighb’ring stand,</div>
<div class="i2">And with the knocker in his hand,</div>
<div class="i1">Plung’d headlong in a cab!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Never, I ween, did driver</div>

<div class="i2">And fury of the Force.</div>

<div class="i1">And (heedless of the lodgers)</div>
<div class="i2">It was done with three times three.</div>
<div class="i1">And they took the rifled knocker,</div>
<div class="i2">And hung it up on high,</div>
<div class="i1">And there it stands in Johnson’s rooms,</div>
<div class="i2">To witness if I lie.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And in the nights of winter,</div>
<div class="i2">When things are rather slow,</div>

<div class="i2">Uncertain where to go;</div>
<div class="i1">To Johnson’s humble chambers,</div>
<div class="i2">In little knots drop in,</div>
<div class="i1">To smoke his soothing birdseye,</div>
<div class="i2">And quaff his cheering gin!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">When the bottled stout is opened,</div>

<div class="i2">“The bridge must straight go down,</div>

<div class="i2">Nought else can save the town.”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Then out spake brave Sibthorpius,</div>
<div class="i2">Up to the council riding,</div>
<div class="i1">“I’ll keep the bridge&mdash;Chartists be hanged,</div>

<div class="i1">What Honourable Member</div>

<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Ten">X.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">“Sibthorpius,” said Lord Russell,</div>

<div class="i2">And forth then rushed the Three.</div>
<div class="i1">Meanwhile, the Specials round them,</div>
<div class="i2">Came each man with an axe,</div>
<div class="i1">And Russell gave a mighty blow,</div>
<div class="i1">And Morpeth pummelled with a crow</div>
<div class="i1">The bridge ’neath which the Thames doth flow,</div>
<div class="i2">Resounded with their whacks!</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Eleven">XI.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">One Member smote proud Cuffey,</div>
<div class="i2">The second rushed at Jones,</div>
<div class="i1">Unmoved by Chartist yelling,</div>
<div class="i2">Undaunted by the stones.</div>
<div class="i1">Sibthorpius at Feargus</div>
<div class="i2">Darted one horrid thrust</div>
<div class="i1">And the plebian’s puddle blood</div>

<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Twelve">XII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">And now the Bridge of Westminster</div>

<div class="i1">Then quickly the two members</div>

<div class="i2">Alone in all his pride.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Thirteen">XIII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Then with a crash like thunder,</div>

<p>The six points demanded by the Chartists in 1848, were:
<cite>Universal Suffrage</cite>, <cite>Vote by Ballot</cite>, <cite>Annual Parliaments</cite>,
<cite>Payment of the Members</cite>, <cite>the Abolition of the Property
Qualification</cite>, and <cite>Equal Electoral Districts</cite>.</p>

<p>Forty years ago these proposals were considered terribly
revolutionary, and when the leaders of the movement&mdash;Ernest
Jones, Fergus O’Connor, Vincent and Stephens&mdash;proposed
to hold a mass meeting at Kennington, and march
to Westminster, it was feared there would be a riot.
Special constables were enrolled in large numbers, and
strong measures were taken by the police, but little actual
disturbance occurred. Colonel Sibthorp, a very eccentric
M. P., was especially violent in his denunciations of the
Chartists, but it need scarcely be said that the poem is
entirely imaginary as to the fight at Westminster Bridge,
and the part he took in it.</p>

<div class="i1">Big Heenan of Benicia,</div>
<div class="i2">By ninety-nine gods he swore,</div>
<div class="i1">That the bright belt of England</div>
<div class="i2">Should grace her sons no more.</div>
<div class="i1">By ninety-nine he swore it,</div>
<div class="i2">And named the ‘fisting’ day&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">‘East and west and south and north,’</div>
<div class="i1">Said Richard Mayne, ‘ride forth, ride forth,</div>

<div class="i2">Policemen&mdash;mind your eye!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Sir Richard’s bold moss-troopers</div>
<div class="i2">Looked out uncommon keen,</div>
<div class="i1">From park and plain and prairie,</div>
<div class="i2">From heath and upland green;</div>
<div class="i1">From Essex fens and fallows,</div>
<div class="i2">From Hampshire, dale and down,</div>
<div class="i1">From Sussex’ hundred leagues of sand,</div>
<div class="i1">To Shropshire’s fat and flowery land,</div>
<div class="i1">And Cheshire’s wild and wasted strand,</div>
<div class="i2">And Yorkshire’s heather brown;&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And so, of course, the fight came oft</div>
<div class="i2">A dozen miles from Town.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then first stept out big Heenan,</div>
<div class="i2">Unmatched for breadth and length;</div>
<div class="i1">And in his chest it might be guessed;</div>
<div class="i2">He had unpleasant strength.</div>
<div class="i1">And to him went the Sayers</div>
<div class="i2">That looked both small and thin,</div>
<div class="i1">But well each practised eye could read</div>
<div class="i1">The ‘lion and the bull-dog’ breed,</div>
<div class="i1">And from each fearless stander-by</div>
<div class="i1">Rang out that genuine British cry,</div>
<div class="i2">‘<em>Go in, my boy</em>,&mdash;and win!’</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And he went in&mdash;and smote him</div>
<div class="i2">Through mouthpiece and through cheek;</div>
<div class="i1">And Heenan smote him back again</div>
<div class="i2">Into the ensuing week:</div>
<div class="i1">Full seven days thence he smote him,</div>
<div class="i2">With one prodigious crack,</div>
<div class="i1">And th’ undaunted Champion straight</div>
<div class="i1">Discerned that he was five feet eight,</div>
<div class="i2">When flat upon his back:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst a great shout of laughter</div>
<div class="i2">Rose from the Yankee pack.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">As from the flash the bullet,</div>
<div class="i2">Out sprang the Sayers then,</div>
<div class="i1">And dealt the huge Benician</div>
<div class="i2">A vast thump on the chin;</div>
<div class="i1">And thrice and four times sternly</div>
<div class="i2">Drove in the shatt’ring blow;</div>
<div class="i1">And thrice and four times wavered</div>
<div class="i2">The herculean foe;</div>
<div class="i1">And his great arms swung wildly,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And now no sound of laughter</div>
<div class="i2">Was heard from either side,</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst feint, and draw, and rally,</div>
<div class="i2">The cautious Bruisers tried;</div>
<div class="i1">And long they sparred and counter’d</div>

<div class="i1">So fierce and quick, it swept away</div>
<div class="i2">Th’ opposing guard like sapling spray&mdash;,</div>

<p>This excellent parody has appeared in numerous editions
of <cite>Puck on Pegasus</cite> (published by Chatto and Windus,
London), it is here given by special permission, and with
corrections and additions recently made by the author.</p>

<p>The desperate fight it describes took place at Farnborough
on April 17, 1860. Tom Sayers, the Champion of England,
stood only about 5 feet 8 inches high, whilst John
Heenan, the “Benicia Boy” was upwards of 6 feet in
height. Both men showed great courage and endurance,
but Sayers displayed the most science, and had not the fight
been interrupted, he would, in all probability, have been
victorious, as Heenan’s eyes were fast closing up from the
punishment he had received. As the fight was a draw, a
silver belt was afterwards presented to each of the men.
<cite>Punch</cite> also had a very long parody on the subject, from which
a few verses may be quoted.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="i2">Vector, whose fourfold power</div>
<div class="i1">Had puzzled many a weary head,</div>

<div class="i2">Long past the midnight hour.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">C went at once for Vector</div>

<div class="i2">The great Quaternion low:</div>

<div class="i2">Been risen to the tenth.</div>
<div class="i1">Little cared C I ween for he</div>
<div class="i2">Had smote him to the Nth.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Next Beta marked how Theta</div>

<div class="i2">A knotty old cube root;</div>
<div class="i1">Thrice round his head he waved it,</div>
<div class="i2">And then the weapon sprung</div>
<div class="i1">Like bolt from bow, a mighty blow,</div>
<div class="i2">On Alpha’s crest it rung.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He reeled, and first on Beta</div>
<div class="i2">Leaned, for a breathing space,</div>
<div class="i1">Then dashed his Co-efficient</div>

<div class="i1">Harcourtius of Derbiæ,</div>

<div class="i2">Should hold Guildhall no more.</div>
<div class="i1">In Right’s great name he swore it,</div>
<div class="i2">And with good heart and will</div>
<div class="i1">Made ready for the desperate fight&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">That is to say, he named a night</div>
<div class="i2">For bringing in his Bill,</div>
<div class="i1">And when the night (’twas  Tuesday)</div>
<div class="i2">In order due came round,</div>
<div class="i1">In serried ranks the Liberals</div>
<div class="i2">Were in their places found;</div>
<div class="i1">And with a mighty shouting</div>
<div class="i2">Their gallant chief they cheered:</div>

<div class="i2">They ardently “Hear-hear’d!”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But ’mongst the City Fathers</div>
<div class="i2">Was turmoil and affright,</div>

<div class="i2">And locomotion stopped,</div>
<div class="i1">An awesome thing it was to hear</div>
<div class="i2">The h’s that they dropp’d!</div>
<div class="i1">For many a City Father,</div>

<div class="i2">In short, they all were there,</div>

<div class="i1">They held a council standing</div>
<div class="i2">About the Lobby floor,</div>

<div class="i1">But, after hot discussion</div>
<div class="i2">Of this and that design,</div>

<div class="i2">Invincible to be;</div>

<div class="i1">Meanwhile the Civic forces,</div>
<div class="i2">Despite their recent meal,</div>
<div class="i1">Are, in their hearts, so much afraid,</div>
<div class="i1">That all the blatant noise they made</div>
<div class="i2">Could not their fear conceal.</div>
<div class="i1">In vain did Magnus Blockus</div>
<div class="i2">His snuff-box pass around,</div>
<div class="i1">In vain did Auceps try to cheer</div>
<div class="i1">His followers, or far or near,</div>
<div class="i2">By his loud “Yah, Yah’s” sound.</div>
<div class="i1">And far above the arena,</div>
<div class="i2">More City Fathers sat;</div>
<div class="i1">Smug, dense, and dull and vulgar,</div>
<div class="i2">Crass, fatuous, and fat.</div>
<div class="i1">And full of dread foreboding</div>
<div class="i2">Lest, if the Bill were past,</div>
<div class="i1">Of civic jobs and shuffles</div>
<div class="i2">They’d seen the very last.</div>

<div class="i1">And the Liveries robbed the poor man,</div>
<div class="i2">And the Council jobbed the rates.</div>
<div class="i1">Most trusts were misdirected,</div>
<div class="i2">And endowments misapplied,</div>
<div class="i1">When Harcourtius and Firthius</div>
<div class="i2">Stood out boldly side by side.</div>
<div class="i1">Stout Firthius sprang on Auceps,</div>
<div class="i2">And in a moment’s space</div>
<div class="i1">He hurled, with crushing ardour,</div>
<div class="i2">A Blue-book in his face,</div>
<div class="i1">He saw, too, McArturus,</div>
<div class="i2">With soup-nerved vengeance burn,</div>
<div class="i1">And with one shot upset him,</div>
<div class="i2">Fired from a new “Return.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then Cardenus of Barum,</div>
<div class="i2">On Gee-o-Emius rushed;</div>
<div class="i1">Cardenus, who, neath cab or ’bus</div>
<div class="i2">So frequently is crushed;</div>
<div class="i1">And Gee-O-Emius met his dash</div>
<div class="i2">With a compelling frown,</div>
<div class="i1">Then, with a force like Pickford’s van,</div>
<div class="i2">Bore his assailant down.</div>
<div class="i1">’Twas Firthius smote down Luskus,</div>
<div class="i2">Statistics laid him low;</div>
<div class="i1">And to Cottoniensis’ heart</div>
<div class="i2">Harcourtius sent a blow;</div>
<div class="i1">Owdenus muttered curses,</div>
<div class="i2">And ’midst the rising din</div>
<div class="i1">Was heard the voice of him who sits</div>
<div class="i2">For Farringdon Within.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But hark, they cry, “Randolphus!”</div>
<div class="i2">And ’midst a deep’ning roar</div>
<div class="i1">The spry “Quaternian” leader</div>
<div class="i2">Sprang out upon the floor.</div>
<div class="i1">He smiled at those before him,</div>
<div class="i2">A smile serenely sly;</div>
<div class="i1">He eyed the Bumbles near him,</div>
<div class="i2">And scorn was in his eye.</div>
<div class="i1">Quoth he, “In my existence</div>
<div class="i2">I never yet did know</div>
<div class="i1">So very just a measure,</div>
<div class="i2">So very mean a foe,</div>
<div class="i1">The City Corporation!</div>
<div class="i2">Bah! tell me what is that?</div>
<div class="i1">A mass of vulgar ignorance,</div>
<div class="i2">Of fussiness and fat!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then, snatching up a Blue-book,</div>
<div class="i2">He turned him left and right,</div>
<div class="i1">And hurled most damning extracts</div>
<div class="i2">With all his well-known might!</div>
<div class="i1">’Twas vain for poor Northcotus</div>
<div class="i2">To shrewishly protest;</div>
<div class="i1">In vain for Sclater-Boothius</div>
<div class="i2">To beat his massive chest.</div>
<div class="i1">And when the perky Crossius</div>
<div class="i2">To Bumble brought his aid,</div>
<div class="i1">’Twas fun to see how quickly he</div>
<div class="i2">Upon his back was laid.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Meantime, the “whips” their office</div>
<div class="i2">Persistently had plied,</div>
<div class="i1">And all the air was vocal</div>
<div class="i2">With cries of “‘vide,’ ‘vide,’ ‘vide!”</div>
<div class="i1">With one more bound Harcourtius</div>
<div class="i2">At Auceps sternly leapt,</div>
<div class="i1">Then like a stream that bursts its banks,</div>
<div class="i1">In currents twain the rival ranks.</div>
<div class="i2">On to the lobbies swept.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">No sound of joy or sorrow</div>
<div class="i2">Rose from the crowded floor,</div>
<div class="i1">But friends and foes in mute surmise,</div>
<div class="i1">With parted lips and straining eyes,</div>
<div class="i2">Stood gazing at the door,</div>
<div class="i1">And when, from ’mongst the members</div>
<div class="i2">That surged about the Bar,</div>
<div class="i1">They saw the Liberal Whips appear,</div>
<div class="i1">There rose a most stupendous cheer,</div>
<div class="i2">Repeated near and far.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The stricken City Fathers,</div>
<div class="i2">Disgusted, slink away,</div>

<div class="i2">The jocund victors stay,</div>
<div class="i1">Until, midst shouts and laughter,</div>
<div class="i2">And cheering long and loud,</div>
<div class="i1">He passes from the Forum,</div>
<div class="i2">Hailed by the joyous crowd.</div>
<div class="i1">They gave him and Harcourtius</div>
<div class="i2">A banquet straightaway,</div>
<div class="i1">And passed of votes of thanks, at least,</div>
<div class="i2">A score or so a day.</div>
<div class="i1">And they made a graven image</div>
<div class="i2">Of both these statesmen good,</div>
<div class="i1">And set them up where hitherto</div>
<div class="i2">The Civic Griffin stood.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And still their names are music</div>
<div class="i2">Wherever they are heard;</div>

<div class="i2">The Cits all homeward go;</div>

<div class="i3">And circulars were posted forth</div>
<div class="i3">East and west, and south and north,</div>
<div class="i4">Calling members to the fray.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">Charles Cochrane there, whose yellow hair</div>
<div class="i3">Waves o’er his manly brow</div>
<div class="i1">He built a mighty furnace, the cause of all the Row.</div>
<div class="i3">This furnace was more wide and big</div>
<div class="i3">Than any other known,</div>
<div class="i1">And, Cochrane said, t’would make more pig</div>
<div class="i3">As could be clearly shown.</div>
<div class="i1">And then he quoted figures, which were an awful bore,</div>
<div class="i1">And of the members some did yawn, some shuffled on the floor.</div>
<div class="i3">Bell shook his head, and then he said</div>
<div class="i3">The figures were all wrong.</div>
<div class="i1">The blast put in was much <em>too weak</em></div>
<div class="i3">The facts were all <em>too strong</em>!</div>
<div class="i1">And in his pleasant, genial way</div>
<div class="i1">He “hoped the Chair would let him say</div>
<div class="i3">That Cochrane was a fool!”</div>
<div class="i1">Then Cowper great, from Storey’s Gate,</div>
<div class="i3">He raised his voice on high</div>
<div class="i1">And swore an oath, a mighty oath,</div>
<div class="i3">He swore that Bell should die!</div>
<div class="i1">Each chieftain hastened to the brawl</div>
<div class="i1">In vain did Bramwell “Order” call.</div>
<div class="i3">Cried Marshall “What will Europe think?</div>
<div class="i3">When Cochrane hurled a pot of Ink</div>
<div class="i3">Full in the face of Bell!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">Now Williams to the rescue! oh!</div>
<div class="i3">What man alive could tell</div>
<div class="i1">The laughter that arose all round</div>
<div class="i3">When they saw the face of Bell?</div>
<div class="i3">But Bell he rushed at Cochrane</div>
<div class="i3">And smote him fearful blows;</div>
<div class="i3">He gave him <em>one</em> between the eyes,</div>
<div class="i3">And <em>two</em> upon the nose!</div>
<div class="i1">They rose, they fell, with gasp, and yell</div>
<div class="i3">And angry oath and roar;</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst Ink and Blood, one horrid flood</div>
<div class="i3">Did cover all the floor!</div>
<div class="i1">Then, Carbutt, Mighty Hammer, and Bramwell in the Chair</div>
<div class="i1">And Siemens of the Telegraph, did wish they were not there.</div>
<div class="i3">Whilst all the other members thought</div>
<div class="i4">It was a funny way.</div>
<div class="i3">To settle scientific points</div>
<div class="i4">In that far distant day.</div>
<div class="i1">But high above the mighty din, was Hawksley heard to say</div>
<div class="i1">“Ho! Gentlemen, Ho! Gentlemen, let’s stop this horrid fray!”</div>
<div class="i1">So they sent out for the Serjeants, the Serjeants of Police,</div>
<div class="i1">The Constables of Manchester, in the interests of Peace.</div>
<div class="i3">They bade them pick those members up,</div>
<div class="i4">And wipe the blood away,</div>
<div class="i3">Whilst others washed each inky stain</div>
<div class="i4">From off the floor that day.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">But when they picked the foemen up</div>
<div class="i4">No man alive could tell</div>
<div class="i3">Which of the two was Cochrane,</div>
<div class="i4">Nor which of them was Bell!</div>
<div class="i1">But Bell survived the combat, all in the North Contree</div>
<div class="i1">And for his gifts and money, they made him an M.P.</div>
<div class="i3">Whilst Cochrane for his valour</div>
<div class="i4">Got glory and renown,</div>
<div class="i3">As much as could be measured</div>
<div class="i4">Ere the sun went down.</div>

<div class="i1">And in each drawing office, when the argand lamp is lit,</div>

<div class="i1">When the pupil spoils the tracing, and breaks his Archbutt scale</div>

<div class="i1">Alone stood our brave hero,</div>

<p>There are many other parodies of <cite>Horatius</cite>
possessing less general interest than those
already quoted.</p>

<p>As most of them are very long, only a few
verses of each will be given, sufficient to indicate
the subject, and style of treatment. As
the source from whence each is derived will
be named, the complete parodies can easily be
obtained.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the last four or five
verses of <cite>Horatius</cite> have been especially favoured
by the parodists.</p>

<p>This amusing parody originally appeared in <cite>College
Rhymes</cite>, 1855, but has since been issued in pamphlet form
(price sixpence), by Messrs. T. Shrimpton and Son, Oxford,
and has had a large sale.</p>

<p>Several imitations of <cite>Horatius</cite> occur in early volumes
of <cite>Punch</cite>, one as far back as December 4, 1847, entitled
the “Mustering of the Hobbies, a Lay of Modern Babylon,”
refers to politicians many of whom are dead, and to
events most of which are now forgotten. Another, dated
January 26, 1856, “The Sibylline Books, a Lay of
Ancient Rome for the consideration of modern Russia,”
is also quite out of date. It contained certain advice
which <em>Mr. Punch</em> considered advisable to address to the
Emperor of Russia.</p>

<p>When Macaulay was created a baron, it was practically
a life peerage, as he was unmarried and unlikely to
marry, <cite>Punch</cite> had some verses congratulating him on the
event, and referring to Mr. Baron Parke, who, in 1856,
had been raised to the peerage as Lord Wensleydale, with
the usual succession to his heirs male, who did not exist,
and never came into being.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Dauntless Three.</span></p>

<p>This is the title of a parody, issued in pamphlet form
by Messrs. J. Hall and Son, Cambridge. Second edition
1874, price sixpence, and said to be by A. de L. H. It
would certainly be of literary interest to know the author’s
name of this humorous, and scholarly parody of Macaulay’s
<cite>Horatius</cite>, as the same initials are prefixed to another parody,
of a similar character, entitled “<cite>The Battle of Lake Mort</cite>,”
which will be more fully described when dealing with parodies
of Macaulay’s “<cite>Battle of the Lake Regillus</cite>.”</p>

<p>“<cite>The Dauntless Three</cite>,” consists of forty two verses, with
a number of burlesque latin notes. The subject of the parody
is the well worn theme of the “Town and Gown” rows.</p>

<p>An anonymous parody of <cite>Horatius</cite>, published in 1877 in
pamphlet form (price sixpence), by T. Shrimpton and Son,
Oxford. It is a short poem describing a practical joke very
similar to that known as the “Berners Street Hoax,” perpetrated
by Theodore Hook, in 1809.</p>

<p>This consisted in writing to a large number of tradespeople
and others, asking them to call, on various pretexts,
at a certain house, at a fixed hour. In Theodore Hook’s case
the hoax was pure mischief without any malicious intent;
but in <cite>Christ Church Besieged</cite>, the joke is described as having
been planned to annoy a certain Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;s.</p>

<div class="i2">A little lower down.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So in some night next Winter,</div>
<div class="i2">When the cold Easters blow,</div>

<div class="i2">Amid the frozen snow;</div>
<div class="i1">When round the lonely villa</div>
<div class="i2">The fog wets to the skin,</div>
<div class="i1">And the cheap coals of Wallsend</div>

<div class="i1">When the latest bill is opened,</div>

<div class="i1">And now, most of the boroughs</div>
<div class="i2">Have sent their tale of men,</div>
<div class="i1">The Tories clear the hundred,</div>
<div class="i2">And claim the victory then.</div>
<div class="i1">In London’s mighty city,</div>
<div class="i2">A Liberal scarce dare speak;</div>
<div class="i1">A proud man was Lord Salisbury</div>
<div class="i2">As ended the first week.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">But ’mong the Liberal party</div>
<div class="i2">Was anger and dismay,</div>
<div class="i1">As some of their oldest strongholds</div>
<div class="i2">Yielded to Tory sway.</div>
<div class="i1">From all parts of the country</div>
<div class="i2">The messages came in,</div>
<div class="i1">Suggesting ideas, expressing fears,</div>
<div class="i2">Hoping ’gainst hope, to win.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Then out spake William Gladstone,</div>
<div class="i2">A Grand Old Man was he,</div>
<div class="i1">“To every one upon this earth,</div>
<div class="i2">Must come obscurity;</div>
<div class="i1">And how can man yield better,</div>

<div class="i2">I’ll rally all the clans;</div>

<div class="i2">And aid me in my plans?”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Sixteen">XVI.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Then out spake good Lord Hartington,</div>
<div class="i2">A comrade tried was he,</div>
<div class="i1">“Lo, I will stand at thy right hand,</div>
<div class="i2">And fight this fight with thee.”</div>
<div class="i1">And out spake William Forster,</div>
<div class="i2">Of Irish fame was he,</div>
<div class="i1">“I will abide by thy left side,</div>

<div class="i2">Left not a chance untried,</div>
<div class="i1">To crush the combined forces</div>
<div class="i2">Which strangely were allied.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Eighteen">XVIII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">For none were for a Party,</div>
<div class="i2">But all were for the State;</div>
<div class="i1">And the great men helped the poor,</div>
<div class="i2">And the poor men loved the great.</div>
<div class="i1">The lands they’d fairly portion,</div>
<div class="i2">In a way which they knew how,</div>

<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Thirty">XXX.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">To Derbyshire, Lord Hartington,</div>
<div class="i2">Travelled to help a friend;</div>
<div class="i1">While Forster’s serious illness</div>
<div class="i2">Threatened his life to end.</div>
<div class="i1">But when they saw friend Gladstone</div>
<div class="i2">Commence renewed attack</div>
<div class="i1">On a Tory Welchman’s stronghold</div>
<div class="i2">They wished to hurry back.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Thirty-three">XXXIII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">“O voters, county voters,”</div>
<div class="i2">The old man’s heard to say,</div>
<div class="i1">“A Liberal’s life and policy</div>
<div class="i2">Do ye endorse to day.”</div>
<div class="i1">So he spake, and, speaking, opened</div>
<div class="i2">His umbrella with his right,</div>
<div class="i1">And, with his left hand, seized his axe</div>
<div class="i2">And plunged into the fight.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Thirty-four">XXXIV.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">But fiercely raged the conflict,</div>
<div class="i2">Fed by each Party’s gain,</div>
<div class="i1">And fast his strength was failing,</div>
<div class="i2">And heavy grew the strain;</div>
<div class="i1">His voice grew weak and weaker,</div>
<div class="i2">As speeches multiplied,</div>
<div class="i1">And oft they thought him done for,</div>
<div class="i2">But he again revived.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Thirty-six">XXXVI.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">And now the strife is over,</div>
<div class="i2">In Flintshire as elsewhere,</div>
<div class="i1">The Liberal cause has conquered,</div>
<div class="i2">With lots of strength to spare.</div>
<div class="i1">Round Gladstone throng the leaders</div>
<div class="i2">From all parts of the land,</div>
<div class="i1">And each would be the foremost</div>
<div class="i2">To grasp his manly hand.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Thirty-nine">XXXIX.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">And in the nights of winter</div>
<div class="i2">When the stars withhold their smiles,</div>

<div class="i1">And when they had inspected,</div>

<div class="i3">Pitched over Stratford side.</div>
<div class="i1">But ere they sat to dine there</div>
<div class="i3">On fowl and beef and tongue,</div>
<div class="i1">They, on the steamboat fore and aft,</div>
<div class="i1">The wine and bitter beer had quaffed,</div>

<div class="i1">Now dinner barely over,</div>
<div class="i3">With more drink doled to each,</div>
<div class="i1">Higgins the noble shopkeeper,</div>

<div class="i3">The letter H defies,</div>

<div class="i3">Extremely apt to stick.</div>
<div class="i1">At Higgins’ muddled periods</div>
<div class="i3">Stout Podger hurled a sneer,</div>
<div class="i1">And Higgins answered with an oath</div>
<div class="i3">Meet for a Vestry’s ear.</div>

<div class="i1">An empty bottle wielding</div>
<div class="i3">He aimed it at his crown,</div>
<div class="i1">And with unerring fleetness</div>
<div class="i3">Tumbled his foeman down.</div>
<div class="i1">Then flamed the wrath of Vestries,</div>
<div class="i3">And blows and curses sped,</div>
<div class="i1">And fowl-bones flew, and H’s dropped,</div>
<div class="i1">But still undaunted Podger whopped,</div>
<div class="i1">With champagne bottles that had popped,</div>

<div class="i3">That caught him in the eye;</div>
<div class="i1">While Grigg and Globb and Blenkinsop</div>
<div class="i3">Around dealt broken pates;</div>
<div class="i1">Still Podger’s stick dealt many a blow,</div>
<div class="i1">Till mastered by the numerous foe</div>
<div class="i1">That hurled him far and laid him low</div>
<div class="i3">Among the knives and plates.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The Ilford beaks look sternly</div>
<div class="i3">Upon a Guardian’s fault;</div>
<div class="i1">The Ilford beaks fined Podger</div>
<div class="i3">Five pounds for each assault,</div>
<div class="i1">Still let us sing in triumph</div>
<div class="i3">With all a minstrel’s powers,</div>

and Angus B. Reach. <abbr title="Volume Two">Vol. II.</abbr></p>

<p>Jenny Lind made her first appearance at Her Majesty’s
Theatre, London, in May, 1847 (when it was under the
management of Mr. Lumley), with great success. She was
much admired in every part she undertook, but in <cite>Norma</cite>
she had to stand comparison with Madame Grisi, who had
long been identified with it, and opinions widely differed, as
to the superiority of these famous singers in this, now almost
forgotten, opera.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Book of Ballads</cite> edited by “Bon Gaultier,” there
are six burlesque poems supposed to have been written by
competitors for the post of <cite>Poet Laureate</cite>, when, owing to
the death of Robert Southey, that office was vacant. These
are in imitation of Macaulay, Tom Moore, Tennyson,
Lytton, and Montgomery. The imitation of Macaulay is entitled
<cite>The Laureate’s Tourney</cite>, it is by no means striking in its
resemblance, whilst it is utterly destitute of humour, except
for the introduction of one line of vulgar slang, in the midst
of what would otherwise pass for a fairly mellifluous second-rate
ballad. The comic element in nearly every ballad in
that collection is obtained by the same trick in composition,
which is laughable enough when it is novel and unexpected,
but becomes tedious on frequent repetition.</p>

<p>This very odd, old poem doubtless gave the
hint for the modern “Devil’s Walk,” of which
several different versions exist, and the authorship
of which has been variously ascribed to
Professor Porson, to Robert Southey, and to
Samuel Taylor Coleridge.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The generally accepted account of the origin of “The
Devil’s Walk” is that one evening, at the house of the late
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pageno">190</span>
Dr. Vincent, Professor Porson, being <em>cut out</em> at a whist
table was about to take his leave. Mrs. Vincent pressed
him to stay, saying: “I know you will not stay if you are
doing nothing; but the rubber will soon be over, when
you may go in, and, in the meantime, take a pen and ink
at another table and write us some verses.” Dr. Vincent,
in the midst of the game, seconded this request, and added,
“I will give you a subject.”</p>

<p>“You shall suppose that the Devil is come up among
us to see what we are doing, and you shall tell us what observations
he makes.” Porson obeyed these injunctions,
sat down to write, and carried on his composition till his
cruel proscription from the cards was at an end. Sitting
down to the new rubber he put the manuscript into his
pocket.</p>

<p>At supper he was asked to read it, and, as he commonly
resisted every application for copies of his productions of
this kind, a lady, with her pencil, beneath the table, wrote
down what he read. Afterwards, with suitable apologies,
she told him what she had done, and intreated him to revise
her writing. Porson complied with her request, and
the following is printed from the copy corrected by himself.</p>

<p>As usual, under such circumstances, there are other
M.S. copies with material variations. The lines are
coloured by the party feelings of the author, and several
of the topics introduced serve to mark the date of the
composition.</p>

<p>A very similar version is included in the poetical works of
S. T. Coleridge, with a note stating that several of the stanzas
were written by Robert Southey. This version is dated September
1799, and it is stated that it was first printed in the
Morning Post. Several slight verbal alterations occur in it,
as well as the three following very inferior stanzas which do
not occur in the version ascribed to Professor Porson:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the edition of Southey’s works, collected by himself,
<abbr title="Volume Three">Vol. III.</abbr>, the “Devil’s Walk,” is included, with a rather
lengthy “Advertisement,” in which Southey states that,
although the poem was the joint composition of Coleridge
and himself, it had been claimed for Professor Porson.
“Professor Porson,” he says, “never had any part in these
verses as a writer, and it is for the first time that he now
appears in them as the subject of two or three stanzas written
some few years ago, when the fabricated story of his having
composed them … was revived.” The stanzas in
question are more explicit than complimentary to Porson, or
to any other claimant of the authorship. This edition of the
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="pageno">191</span>
poem contains a somewhat detailed account of the manner
in which Southey and Coleridge composed it between them&mdash;</p>

<div class="i1">“While the one was shaving</div>

<p>In 1830 an Edition of <cite>The Devil’s Walk</cite>, was published in
London, with numerous illustrations by Robert Cruikshank
with a memoir of Porson by H. W. Montagu, and long and
somewhat superfluous foot notes.</p>

<p>Following close upon this were two inferior imitations, both
illustrated by Robert Cruikshank, “<cite>The Devil’s Visit</cite>; a
poem, with notes by a Barrister,” London, W. Kidd 1830,
and “<cite>The Real Devil’s Walk</cite>, <span class="sc lowercase">NOT</span> by Professor Porson,”

<p>This poem consists of sixty stanzas, many of which are
directed against leading politicians of the day, and generally
it is out of date and uninteresting. Another long political
imitation, entitled “<cite>Satan Reformer</cite>, by Montgomery the
Third,” appeared in Blackwood for April 1832, this was in
seven parts, and was a strong protest against the Reform
Agitation, the great political question of the day. It is too
long to quote in full, but the first part will give an idea of its
tone, although not nearly so strong in its language as the
others:</p>

<div class="i1">He hid his pared horns, or rather the roots;</div>

<div class="i2">Like a Minister’s Secretary.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">As he travell’d to London, he star’d about,</div>

<div class="i1">But he went the first night to a noted Hell,</div>
<div class="i2">And it gave him consolation.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The Whigs left their cards as a matter of course,</div>
<div class="i2">For he’d letters of introduction;</div>
<div class="i1">And a very learned Gentleman Devil was he,</div>
<div class="i1">In Political Whig-Economy,</div>
<div class="i2">And gave them the best instruction.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">They feasted him often at Holland House;</div>
<div class="i2">But he found so little to teach ’em,</div>
<div class="i1">They were such adepts in the art of misrule,</div>
<div class="i1">That he left them to lecture the Radical School,</div>
<div class="i2">Lest the Whigs should overreach ’em.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For that, quoth Satan, yet must not be,</div>
<div class="i2">And I hold it my chiefest glory,</div>
<div class="i1">If I make Whig and Radical coalesce&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And thus bring affairs to a damnable mess&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Then adieu to the reign of Tory.</div>

<div class="poemdivider"><cite>An Unfinished Rhapsody</cite>.</div>
<div class="i1">The Devil returned to hell by two,</div>
<div class="i2">And he stay’d at home till five;</div>
<div class="i1">When he dined on some homicides done in <em>ragout</em>,</div>
<div class="i1">And a rebel or so in an <em>Irish</em> stew,</div>
<div class="i1">And sausages made of a self-slain Jew&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And bethought himself what next to do,</div>
<div class="i2">“And,” quoth he, “I’ll take a drive.</div>
<div class="i1">I walk’d in the morning, I’ll ride to night;</div>
<div class="i1">In darkness my children take most delight,</div>
<div class="i2">And I’ll see how my favourites thrive.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“And what shall I ride in?” quoth Lucifer, then&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">“If I followed my taste, indeed,</div>
<div class="i1">I should mount in a waggon of wounded men,</div>
<div class="i2">And smile to see them bleed.</div>
<div class="i2">But these will be furnish’d again and again,</div>
<div class="i2">And at present my purpose is speed;</div>
<div class="i1">To see my manor as much as I may,</div>
<div class="i1">And watch that no souls shall be poach’d away.</div>

<div class="i2">A chariot in Seymour Place;</div>
<div class="i1">But they’re lent to two friends, who make me amends,</div>
<div class="i2">By driving my favourite pace:</div>
<div class="i2">And they handle their reins with such a grace.</div>
<div class="i2">I have something for both at the end of their race,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“So now for the earth to take my chance:”</div>
<div class="i2">Then up to the earth sprung he;</div>
<div class="i1">And making a jump from Moscow to France,</div>
<div class="i2">He stepped across the sea,</div>
<div class="i1">And rested his hoof on a turnpike road,</div>
<div class="i2">No very great way from a bishop’s abode.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But first as he flew, I forgot to say</div>
<div class="i1">That he hover’d a moment upon his way,</div>
<div class="i2">To look upon Leipsic plain;</div>
<div class="i1">And so sweet to his eye was its sulphury glare,</div>
<div class="i1">And so soft to his ear was the cry of despair,</div>
<div class="i2">That he perched on a mountain of slain;</div>
<div class="i1">And he gazed with delight from its growing height,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor often on earth had he seen such a sight,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor his work done half as well:</div>
<div class="i1">For the field ran so red with the blood of the dead,</div>
<div class="i2">That it blushed liked the waves of hell!</div>
<div class="i1">Then loudly, and wildly, and long laugh’d he:</div>
<div class="i1">“Methinks they have here little need of <em>me</em>!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">But the softest note that soothed his ear</div>
<div class="i2">Was the sound of a widow sighing;</div>
<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pageno">192</span>
<div class="i1">And the sweetest sight was the icy tear,</div>
<div class="i1">Which horror froze in the blue eye clear</div>
<div class="i2">Of a maid by her lover lying&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">As round her fell her long fair hair;</div>
<div class="i1">And she looked to heaven with that frenzied air,</div>
<div class="i1">Which seem’d to ask if a God were there!</div>
<div class="i1">And, stretch’d by the wall of a ruined hut,</div>
<div class="i1">With its hollow cheek, and eyes half shut,</div>
<div class="i2">A child of famine dying:</div>
<div class="i1">And the carnage begun, when resistance is done</div>
<div class="i2">And the fall of the vainly flying.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But the Devil has reached our cliffs so white,</div>
<div class="i2">And what did he there, I pray?</div>
<div class="i1">If his eyes were good, he but saw by night</div>
<div class="i2">What we see every day:</div>
<div class="i1">But he made a tour, and kept a journal</div>
<div class="i1">Of all the wondrous sights nocturnal,</div>
<div class="i1">And he sold it in shares to the <em>Men</em> of the <em>Row</em>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_114"

<div class="i1">Who bid pretty well&mdash;but they <em>cheated</em> him though!</div>
<div class="i1">The Devil first saw, as he thought, the <cite>Mail</cite>,</div>
<div class="i2">Its coachman and his coat;</div>
<div class="i1">So instead of a pistol he cock’d his tail,</div>
<div class="i2">And seized him by the throat:</div>
<div class="i1">“Aha!” quoth he, “what have we here?</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis a new barouche, and an ancient peer.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So he sat him on his box again,</div>
<div class="i2">And bade him have no fear,</div>
<div class="i1">But be true to his club, and staunch to his rein,</div>
<div class="i2">His brothel, and his beer;</div>

<div class="i1">But he heard as he purposed to enter in there,</div>
<div class="i2">That “the Lords” had received a summons;</div>

<div class="i1">He might peep at the peers, though to hear them were flat;</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He saw the Lord Liverpool<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_115"

<div class="i2">The Lord Westmoreland certainly silly,</div>

<div class="i2">Because the Catholics would <em>not</em> rise,</div>

<div class="i1">Death rose from off his tombstone bed,</div>
<div class="i2">With joy and agitation,</div>

<div class="i2">Of an overcharged population.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And first he ’gan to don his clothes,</div>
<div class="i2">His bony ribs to hide;</div>
<div class="i1">Of a couple of palls he made his smalls,</div>
<div class="i2">For his shanks they were somewhat wide.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For a kerchief around his neck he tied</div>
<div class="i2">A winding sheet in a noose,</div>
<div class="i1">And he slipt his feet in the coffins of twins,</div>
<div class="i2">Which made him a pair of shoes.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">From fifty coffins the cloth he tore,</div>
<div class="i2">(The owners were dead as mutton)</div>
<div class="i1">And a gay coat made&mdash;for on it he wore,</div>
<div class="i2">A death plate for every button.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">As to what he had to cover his skull</div>
<div class="i2">I really cannot speak poz,</div>
<div class="i1">But he made of his dart a walking stick,</div>
<div class="i2">And went forth <em>like a Plague</em> as he was.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">First he called on a brewer of high renown,</div>
<div class="i2">And begged of him to taste his own swig,</div>
<div class="i1">But scarce had he time to twig the hop</div>
<div class="i2">Ere Death made him <em>hop the twig</em>.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He saw a parson, like many there are,</div>
<div class="i2">Much fonder of taking than giving,</div>
<div class="i1">So Death for once played the Bishop’s part,</div>
<div class="i2">And deprived him of his <em>living</em>.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He made a lawyer (who was first in the law)</div>
<div class="i2">And disclaimed all interference</div>
<div class="i1">With the courts on earth&mdash;on those below,</div>
<div class="i2">Soon <em>enter his appearance</em>.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He caught a thief with purse in hand&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">The halter stopped his breath&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">For, as if by the sudden tidings killed,</div>
<div class="i2">The <em>noose</em> it was his death.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A bellows maker at his work</div>
<div class="i2">Death saw, and seeing, grinned,</div>
<div class="i1">And he who made the bellows blow,</div>
<div class="i2">Right soon did <em>slip the wind</em>.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Unto a cobbler in his stall</div>
<div class="i2">No better fate befell,</div>
<div class="i1">Death quickly made him leave <em>his awl</em>,</div>
<div class="i2">And bid his <em>last</em> farewell.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A gardener&mdash;one of old Adam’s trade&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Who rose before Aurora,</div>

<div class="i2">By proving the florist’s <em>Floorer</em>.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But Death at last met with his match,</div>
<div class="i2">An annuitant eighty and eight,</div>
<div class="i1">Death knew that his life would be death to a score,</div>
<div class="i2">(For nought kills like envy and hate),</div>
<div class="i1">So, because he should thereby get victims galore,</div>
<div class="i2">He bade the old gentleman wait.</div>

<div class="i1">And over the leader, and over the news</div>

<div class="i1">But the Devil he very soon finish’d the job,</div>

<div class="i1">When, for the want of some better employment</div>
<div class="i2">In a “Robbery” he had a hand.</div>

<div class="i1">He set up a joke by W&mdash;&mdash;l;</div>
<div class="i2">But, thinking it couldn’t be meant,</div>
<div class="i1">The Devil smil’d, for he headed it</div>
<div class="i2">“A Serious Accident.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A speech of the Marquis of L&mdash;&mdash;’s came next</div>
<div class="i2">But it was beyond endurance;</div>
<div class="i1">So the Devil took pity and headed it</div>
<div class="i2">“A Melancholy Occurence.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But then the young Devil bethought himself,</div>
<div class="i2">He might in an error fall;</div>
<div class="i1">For a speech such as that, he clearly saw,</div>
<div class="i2">Requir’d no <em>head</em> at all.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He then had a speech of H&mdash;&mdash;t’s to do,</div>
<div class="i2">Where, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mirabile dictu!</i> a word or</div>
<div class="i1">Two of his Latin Mr. H. recollected;</div>

<div class="i1">A Joke, too, by C&mdash;&mdash;r, came into his hands,</div>

<div class="i1">To be C&mdash;&mdash;r’s own; so he headed it</div>
<div class="i2">“Extraordinary Longevity.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">However, he thought at a heading like that,</div>
<div class="i2">Some persons might kick up a bobbery;</div>
<div class="i1">And, as the joke was a decided Joe Miller,</div>
<div class="i2">He called it a “Daring Robbery.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He set up a leading article on</div>
<div class="i2">The advantage ’twould be to the nation&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">If Lord Grey would but make a new batch of peers,</div>
<div class="i2">Which he called “Beauties of the Creation.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A speech on Reform, too, by W&mdash;&mdash;l, he did</div>
<div class="i2">So full of disjointed inelegance,</div>

<div class="i2">With the title of “Foreign Intelligence.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The debate on Pluralities next he compos’d;</div>
<div class="i2">But, finding the incomes so large</div>
<div class="i1">And the duty so little, he headed it</div>
<div class="i2">“Extraordinary Charge.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">An extract from Satan Montgomery’s poems</div>
<div class="i2">Is the next thing the Devil commences;</div>

<div class="i2">He puts it among the “Offences.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A speech of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> P&mdash;&mdash;l was his next job;</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So into a corner the Devil sneaks,</div>

<div class="i1">From his sulphurous realm as the sun goes down</div>
<div class="i2">The Devil is walking once more,</div>
<div class="i1">To visit his favourite vineyard, the Town</div>
<div class="i2">That stretches by Thames’s shore.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Over the bridges and through the Parks</div>
<div class="i2">He strolls, and along the streets,</div>
<div class="i1">A presence that fails to elicit remarks</div>
<div class="i2">From the hurrying hundreds he meets.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">There is nought to suggest that he comes as a guest</div>
<div class="i2">From regions torrid and drouthy,</div>
<div class="i1">He has altered his ways since the simpler days</div>
<div class="i2">Of Coleridge and Southey.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A jacket of red and breeches of blue</div>
<div class="i2">He knows would be far too striking,</div>
<div class="i1">And as for a tail!&mdash;even Darwin’s crew</div>
<div class="i2">Would hold that in sore misliking.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He sees a spectral scare-crow thing</div>
<div class="i2">Slink into a slum-fouled alley,</div>
<div class="i1">And he mutters, “With cowl and with scythe and wing,</div>
<div class="i2"><em>He</em> might lord it in Death’s own Valley.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He sees a roof-rotten, muck-sodden den,</div>
<div class="i2">To the gutter ready to tumble.</div>
<div class="i1">Says he, “Well, if this be the dwelling of men,</div>
<div class="i2"><em>We</em> haven’t much reason to grumble.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then steps he into a “tenement-house,”</div>

<div class="i1">“Little need,” chuckles he, “for a lock or a key</div>
<div class="i2">Whilst <em>my</em> brace of friends stand sentry.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He climbs a rotten and rickety stair,</div>
<div class="i2">Foul filth its cracked walls smearing.</div>
<div class="i1">“Why, chaos,” says he, “had a pleasanter air,</div>
<div class="i2">And needed less careful steering.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He sees commingling of Labour and Vice</div>
<div class="i2">In joint contamination.</div>
<div class="i1">Quoth he, “This, indeed, were a spectacle nice</div>
<div class="i2">For Belial’s contemplation.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Sees Childhood, broken with ill-paid toil,</div>

<div class="i2">Than the ogre worshipped in Ammon:</div>
<div class="i1">Beelzebub’s doughty, and Astaroth’s good,</div>
<div class="i1">As snarers of souls with a crown or a snood,</div>
<div class="i1">But the first, most ubiquitous, best of my brood,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So Satan, seeing that all went right</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The Devil’s Excursion to London.</span></div>
<div class="i1">Old Nick had just finished his London reports,</div>
<div class="i3">Which gave him so much satisfaction,</div>
<div class="i1">That he tucked up his tail, took the Underground rail,</div>
<div class="i1">Bought a “Saturday Sneer” and a “Dublin Mail,”</div>
<div class="i3">And went off to the scene of action.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">As he passed the palatial mansions and clubs,</div>
<div class="i3">He nodded to many a friend;</div>
<div class="i1">And he feasted his eyes on the fetid styes,</div>
<div class="i1">And his ears on the brutal oaths and cries,</div>
<div class="i3">Where the poor were packed and penned.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And it made his sable majesty grin,</div>
<div class="i3">For it needed no prophet to tell</div>
<div class="i1">That the seeds thus sown of sorrow and sin,</div>
<div class="i1">Harrowed by filthiness, watered by gin,</div>
<div class="i3">Would provide a rich harvest for hell.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He saw civic Dives, and some of his brood,</div>
<div class="i3">At a sybarite feast in the City;</div>
<div class="i1">And he thought of the thousands pining for food,</div>
<div class="i1">And the Devil himself was almost in the mood</div>
<div class="i3">To feel a sensation of pity.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He called at the Mansion House, saw the Lord Mayor,</div>
<div class="i3">“Permit me to wish you good day, sir.</div>
<div class="i1">The City and I have been excellent friends,</div>
<div class="i1">But if all comes about that our Ritchie intends,</div>
<div class="i3">The last of Lord Mayors is <em>Decay-sir</em>.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">To the Houses of Parliament next he went,</div>
<div class="i3">But to stay he was quite unable,</div>
<div class="i1">For the jabber and jaw made him feel so queer,</div>
<div class="i1">That he swore to his friend Hughes-Hallett, “Oh dear,</div>
<div class="i3">It is worse than the Tower of Babel!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But as Balfour was near, he said, “Arthur, my dear,</div>
<div class="i3">Never care for J. M. or Trevelyan.</div>
<div class="i1">Your uncle’s bold policy just pleases me,</div>
<div class="i1">So stick to coercion, and soon we may see</div>
<div class="i3">Pat goaded right into rebellion.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">At midnight he wandered around the West-end,</div>
<div class="i3">And remarked, with a dash of profanity,</div>
<div class="i1">“It’s a terrible, dissolute, profligate sink;</div>
<div class="i1">It makes me laugh, and I wink as I think</div>
<div class="i3">Of British Christianity.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But the London Sunday tickled him most,</div>
<div class="i3">And he stroked his tail with glee;</div>
<div class="i1">“Shut up all innocent recreation,</div>
<div class="i1">And open your gin-shops, Pecksniffian nation&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">And so pay homage to ME.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Looking in at a meeting of Brewers and Bungs,</div>
<div class="i3">He said, amidst deafening cheers,</div>
<div class="i1">Such allies deserve my best consideration,</div>
<div class="i1">And if you’re disturbed without full compensation,</div>
<div class="i3">Come for it to ME, my dears.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Some Jingoes were busy creating a scare.</div>
<div class="i3">And he murmured, with jubilation,</div>
<div class="i1">“All Europe is stuffed with combustible matter,</div>
<div class="i1">And a single live spark from this truculent chatter</div>
<div class="i3">Would cause a vast conflagration.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The very idea of another great war</div>
<div class="i3">Amongst Europe’s countless legions</div>
<div class="i1">Made him chuckle, and dance, and yell;</div>
<div class="i1">And he sent a sixpenny wire to hell,</div>
<div class="i3">“Enlarge the infernal regions.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He heard some sailors, in Ratcliff Highway,</div>
<div class="i3">“Rule Britannia” bawling;</div>
<div class="i1">And his tail with pleasure began to wag,</div>
<div class="i1">For he loved this bit of blasphemous brag,</div>
<div class="i3">And joined in the caterwauling.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He called at the School Board, and gave the big D.</div>
<div class="i3">A nice little bit of soft solder.</div>
<div class="i1">It gave him, he said, a most pleasant sensation</div>
<div class="i1">To see how they tinkered at education,</div>
<div class="i3">(D. sternly called him to order.)</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pageno">196</span>
<div class="i1">Just as he was thinking where next he should go,</div>
<div class="i3">For Diggle had caused him a flurry,</div>
<div class="i1">Who should he see but his Grace the Primate</div>
<div class="i1">So “to oblige Benson,” and cursing the climate,</div>
<div class="i3">He went back to Hell in a hurry.</div>

<p>The earliest announcements of the late Covent Garden
management was a piece entitled “Trafalgar Square, or the
Nelson Monument.” We have obtained the following
slight information respecting it. The drama is described as

“a grand architectural and historical burletta,” in two acts;
and the prologue was to have been spoken by Mr.
Widdicomb, as <cite>Time</cite>. The two acts comprise the commencement
and completion, and a lapse of twenty years
is supposed to take place between them, in which time “the
boy,” who is the principal character, becomes a middle-aged
man.</p>

it can give offence. The parody has, however, one defect, it

“<cite>Douglas</cite>,” which was originally produced in Edinburgh,
and was afterwards brought out at Covent Garden Theatre,
London, on March 14, 1757.</p>

<p>This tragedy gave rise to a work entitled “<cite>Douglas</cite>, a

<p>The following parody appeared in <cite>The New Tory Guide</cite>,
a small collection of political and satirical <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeux d’esprit</i>
published by J. Ridgway, London, in 1819. “The Doctor”
was a nickname bestowed, by his political opponents, upon
Henry Addington, first Viscount Sidmouth, who was the
son of a medical man, Anthony Addington, M.D.</p>

<p>Henry Addington was Prime Minister in 1801, he was
created a Viscount in 1805, and held several lucrative
appointments. He was the subject of many bitter lampoons,
and in 1817 he attempted by strong measures to
limit the freedom of the Press, in which he signally failed.
Hone’s publications contain several caricatures of him by
George Cruikshank, as well as the following parody, which
is there ascribed to the pen of the Right Hon. George
Canning, but without any mention of the paper in which it
first appeared. It is also quoted in <abbr title="Volume Eight">Vol. VIII.</abbr> of <cite>The Spirit
of the Public Journals for 1804</cite>, where it is stated to have
been taken from the <cite>Oracle</cite>.</p>

<p>Samuel Whitbread, M.P., took a very active part in the
rebuilding of Drury Lane Theatre, which had recently been
destroyed by fire. Mr. Whitbread is frequently mentioned
in <cite>The Rejected Addresses</cite>. He committed suicide in 1815.</p>

<p><cite>The Mélange</cite> (Liverpool, 1834), also contains another
parody on the same original. It is an address supposed to be
delivered by a lad named William Leigh, who was wounded
in the Peterloo massacre in 1819, when the Yeomanry
Cavalry and Hussars brutally charged into a public meeting
held to deliberate on the Reform Bill, and killed and
wounded many people. The parody is now devoid of
interest.</p>

<div class="i0"><span class="sc">Lord R. Churchill</span>:</div>
<div class="i1">My name is Randolph; in the Blenheim fields</div>
<div class="i1">My father fed his flocks; a frugal duke</div>
<div class="i1">Whose constant care was to increase his store</div>
<div class="i1">Of ready money, hoarded for my sake,</div>
<div class="i1">That I, although not heir, might have wherewith</div>
<div class="i1">To help me in my fight for power and place.</div>
<div class="i1">For I had suddenly (what time I sat</div>
<div class="i1">For Woodstock borough) gained myself much fame,</div>
<div class="i1">And finding that sharp wits, and daring pluck,</div>
<div class="i1">And matchless impudence were strangely rare</div>
<div class="i1">Amongst the Tories, straightway resolved</div>
<div class="i1">To raise myself, as in the past men said</div>
<div class="i1">That wily Hebrew and great Tory chief</div>
<div class="i1">Lord Beaconsfield, long time as Dizzy known,</div>
<div class="i1">Had raised himself to foremost place and fame.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Aye, I had read his doings, and I longed</div>
<div class="i1">To follow in the path of such a chief</div>
<div class="i1">And trade, as he did, on the ignorance</div>
<div class="i1">Of those who called themselves Conservative.</div>
<div class="i1">What happ’d I need not tell you; ’tis enough</div>
<div class="i1">That Fate soon granted what my soul desired,</div>
<div class="i1">And that the chance I yearn’d for came full soon,</div>
<div class="i1">I pass in silence o’er those merry months</div>
<div class="i1">When aided by three henchmen (each of whom</div>
<div class="i1">Has since had cause to bless the day he helped me),</div>
<div class="i1">I made notorious our Fourth Party’s name.</div>
<div class="i1">Are not its deeds in <em>Hansard</em> duly writ?</div>
<div class="i1">How ’twas  I teased and “drew” the Grand old Man?</div>
<div class="i1">How, too, I all but broke poor Northcote’s heart?</div>
<div class="i1">These things are recent, and men still recall</div>
<div class="i1">How, like a freelance, rising from my seat,</div>
<div class="i1">I made my verbal spear thrusts right and left,</div>
<div class="i1">And dealt deep wounds to friend and foe alike.</div>
<div class="i1">Men still recall, I say, the things I did,</div>
<div class="i1">When office came to crown my lawlessness,</div>
<div class="i1">And the proud Marquis had to own my might;</div>
<div class="i1">How, cool and confident, I laid my plans,</div>
<div class="i1">And, armed with weapons such as Dizzy used,</div>
<div class="i1">Made haste to wield them. Aye! whilst others slept</div>
<div class="i1">I hovered round the Tory camp and shot</div>
<div class="i1">My venowed arrows till the air was full</div>
<div class="i1">Of groaning, as the wounded Tory dolts</div>
<div class="i1">Were borne complaining to the House of Lords.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Thus did I clear the path that led me here,</div>
<div class="i1">Thus paved the way to that great victory</div>
<div class="i1">Which has been gained but lately o’er our foes.</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis true that other leaders led the van.</div>
<div class="i1">Whigs fought and won, but Tories claimed the spoil,</div>
<div class="i1">And I, insisting on a lion’s share,</div>
<div class="i1">Am here to-day as Leader of that House</div>
<div class="i1">In which I’ve played my pranks in sessions past,</div>
<div class="i1">And outraged precedent and party faith.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Yes, Randolph is my name, I would repeat,</div>
<div class="i1">And whilst my brother Blenheim doth denude</div>
<div class="i1">Of all its treasures, to increase the sum</div>
<div class="i1">Accruing after mortgages are paid,</div>
<div class="i1">I bring the House of Churchill fresh renown</div>
<div class="i1">(My foes <em>will</em> call it notoriety),</div>
<div class="i1">And seated on this bench prepare to reap</div>
<div class="i1">Those oaths so wild I sowed below the gangway</div>
<div class="i1">But thirty-seven, yet trusted to control</div>
<div class="i1">The realm’s finances, and to have my way</div>
<div class="i1">Despite the Marquis and his played-out friends;</div>
<div class="i1">But thirty-seven, yet filled with the belief</div>
<div class="i1">That greater honour still will soon be mine.</div>
<div class="i1">And that the baser Tories, tickled by</div>
<div class="i1">My daring tricks, my voluble command</div>
<div class="i1">Of words abusive, and the ready way</div>
<div class="i1">I pelt my friends and foes with verbal mud,</div>
<div class="i1">Will with one voice proceed to summon me</div>

<div class="i1">In drawing in pencil, in chalks, and the tinting</div>
<div class="i1">That’s called Oriental, she must not be stint in;</div>
<div class="i1">She must paint upon paper, and satin, and velvet;</div>
<div class="i1">And if she knows gilding, she’ll not need to shelve it,</div>
<div class="i1">Dancing, of course, with the newest gambades,</div>

<div class="i1">Arithmetic, history, joined with chronology,</div>

<div class="i1">That her charges’ young limbs may be pliant to any call.</div>
<div class="i1">Their health, play, and studies, and moral condition,</div>

<span class="sc">eparting</span> from the plan hitherto
adopted in this collection, Thackeray
will have to be considered not only as the
author of many poems which have formed
the bases of parodies, but also as himself
the writer of almost innumerable parodies
and burlesques, both in verse and in prose.
Having, indeed, such a natural <em>penchant</em> for
travestie that he would rather parody himself,
than remain long serious, or philosophical.
One of his early friends and schoolfellows
wrote of him, that, when quite a boy at the
Charterhouse School, “he was known for
his faculty of making verses, chiefly parodies.”</p>

<p>I only remember one, a parody on a poem
by L. E. L. about ‘Violets, dark blue
violets,’ which Thackeray translated into

‘Cabbages, bright green cabbages,’ and we
thought it very witty.”</p>

<p>This parody will be given later on, but considerations
of space render it necessary to be
sparing of comment on Thackeray’s work as a
parodist; some of his best poetical parodies
will be given, as well as a list of his prose
burlesques. But for historical details of these
famous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeux d’esprit</i>, with explanations of the
allusions contained in them, the reader can be
confidently recommended to turn to Anthony
Trollope’s charming volume on Thackeray,
in the “English Men of Letters” series, published
by Macmillan &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, London.</p>

<p>Certainly, as Anthony Trollope therein
remarks, no writer ever had a stronger proclivity
towards parody than Thackeray, and
there is no form of literary drollery more
dangerous. The parody will often mar the
gem of which it coarsely reproduces the outward
semblance.</p>

<p>But it must be acknowledged of Thackeray,
that he has done little or no injury by his
parodies. They run over with fun, but are so
contrived that they do not lessen the flavour of
the original. In the little set of verses of his
own, called <cite>The Willow Tree</cite>, and his own
parody on the same, we see how effective a
parody may be in destroying the sentiment of
the piece parodied.</p>

<p>But in dealing with other authors, he has
been grotesque without being severely critical,
and has been very like, without making ugly
or distasteful that which he has imitated.</p>

<p>It is stated that Thackeray first sang this amusing piece of
nonsense <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extempore</i>. When it first found its way into print
is not known, but it occurs as early as 1863 in an article on
<cite>Thackeray</cite> which appeared in the now defunct, “North
British Review.” Prior to that date an incorrect version
was printed in some American newspapers, and rumour at
once fixed upon O. W. Holmes as the author. Perhaps
Holmes may have written a parody on it, but if so, it does
not appear in his collected poems.</p>

expose the harsh manner in which the tenants were treated

<p>Thackeray’s translations, or imitations, of some of Beranger’s
songs are well known, it is interesting to compare
them with the versions written by <cite>Father Prout</cite> (the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Francis Mahony), who has not only followed the originals
more closely, but seems also to have preserved more
of their light-hearted gaiety, than did Thackeray. When
Thackeray projected “<cite>The Cornhill Magazine</cite>” Father
Prout sent an “Inaugurative Ode to the author of
<cite>Vanity Fair</cite>.” Thackeray was too fastidious to allow it
to appear exactly in the form in which it was written, but
having considerably altered it, and added two stanzas,
it was printed in the first number of the Cornhill, January,
1860. The two versions will be found in the appendix to
<cite>The Maclise Portrait Gallery</cite> by William Bates, B.A. (London
Chatto and Windus, 1883.) The version given in <cite>The Works
of Father Prout</cite>, published by Messrs. Routledge, London,
is simply a reprint of the Ode as it appeared after it had
been altered, and cut about, by Thackeray.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In his “Memoirs of C. Jeames de la Pluche, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>,” and
“The Ballads of Policeman X” Thackeray allowed his
fondness for eccentric orthography to become somewhat
tedious, but they contain many gems of humour, such as the
song of the love sick Jeames:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Lady Frederick Cavendish’s house, Carlton House-terrace,
and Devonshire House, the town residence of the
Marquis of Hartington, were the centres of interest on the
Opposition side. Mr. Gladstone, who is at present the
guest of Lady Frederick, at half-past ten received a visit
from Mr. Godley, a former private secretary. Lord
Granville walked across from his residence about eleven
o’clock, and had a long interview with Mr. Gladstone,
Sir Henry James, ex-Attorney-General, also called on
Mr. Gladstone, and remained with him for about
half an hour. He was followed by Lord Hartington,
who walked to Carlton House-terrace from the Reform
Club. He and Mr. Gladstone remained in conversation
for over an hour. At the close of the interview his
lordship crossed the street to Lord Granville’s residence,
and in a few minutes they came out together in earnest
conversation. Lord Hartington left the leader of the House
of Lords at the corner by the Athenæum, and strolled back
in the direction of the Duke of York’s Steps, where he was
shortly joined by Lord Rosebery, who had called on Mr.
Gladstone in the meantime. Later in the afternoon Mr.
and Mrs. Gladstone went for a drive in the Park, after
which the former was again visited by Lord Granville and
Lord Derby.”&mdash;<cite>Times.</cite> January 28, 1886.</p>

<p>Lord Lytton’s poetry does not appear to
have offered much temptation to the parodists,
probably because none of it became truly
popular. Many years ago the late Professor
Aytoun wrote some satirical verses on Lytton,
entitled <cite>A Midnight Meditation</cite>, but this, and
Tennyson’s attack upon him in <cite>Punch</cite>, are the
only important burlesques on his poetry.</p>

<p>Several of his plays have, however, been the
subject of burlesques, and many prose parodies
of his novels have been written.</p>

<p>But this prophecy was not to be fulfilled, for on the death
of Wordsworth, in 1850, Tennyson obtained the office and
pension of Poet Laureate. Some years before that event
Tennyson had also received a grant from the Government,
which aroused the jealousy of his brother poets.</p>

<p>In 1846 Mr. Henry Colburn, of London, published an
anonymous satirical poem, entitled <cite>The New Timon</cite>, which
soon became known as the work of Lytton. It contained
the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>There is little reason to doubt that Tennyson wrote
these lines, although they are not included in his works.
Lady Lytton’s description of her future husband, as he
first appeared to her, justifies this charge of foppery
brought against him.</p>

<p>“He had” she wrote, “just returned from Paris, and
was resplendent with French polish, so far as boots
went. His cobweb cambric shirt-front was a triumph of
lace and embroidery, a combination never seen in this
country till six or seven years later, except on babies’
frocks. Studs, too, except in racing stables, were then
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non est</i>, but a perfect galaxy glittered along the milky way
down the centre of this fairy-like <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lingerie</i>. Poor D’Orsay’s
linen gauntlets had not yet burst upon the London world,
but like the little source of a mighty river, Mr. Lytton
Bulwer had three inches of cambric encircling his coat
cuffs, and fastened with jewelled sleeve-links. And though
it then wanted full five years till every man in society was
caned, he also dangled from his ungloved and glittering
right hand, a somewhat gorgeously jewelled-headed ebony
cane, and the dangling was of the scientific kind that had
evidently been ‘learnt, marked, and inwardly digested.’
Miss Landon and I both laughed as I exclaimed:</p>

<p>Lord Lytton’s most successful drama “<cite>The Lady of
Lyons</cite>, or Love and Pride,” was produced at Covent
Garden Theatre, London, on February 15, 1838, when Mr.
Macready played <cite>Claude Melnotte</cite>, and <cite>Pauline</cite> was impersonated
by Miss Helen Faucit, now Lady Theodore
Martin. The plot of the play is absurd and preposterous
in the highest degree, yet Lytton acknowledged that, such
as it was, it had been suggested to him by a pretty little tale
called “The Bellows Mender.” Possibly the success of
Lytton’s play put others on the scent of his original, for on
February 7, 1842, a domestic drama in three acts, entitled
“<cite>Perourou</cite>, the Bellows Mender, and the Beauty of
Lyons,” by W. T. Moncrieff, was produced at Sadler’s
Wells Theatre. Stilted in language, full of clap-trap sentiment,

and utterly destitute of poetry, it is still easy to see
that it had a common origin with <cite>The Lady of Lyons</cite>, from
which it differed in many respects, and was inferior in all.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Model Palace.</span></p>

<p>“When Lord Lytton wrote <cite>The Lady of Lyons</cite> he was in
profound ignorance of one of the blessings in store for the
human race. Nothing had then been heard of health-towns
or model houses, and when Claude Melnotte sought to
dazzle the mind of Pauline with a picture of the retreat love
would conjure up for her, he could think of nothing better
than a ramshackle old palace by the Lake of Como.</p>

<p>Now, had Lord Lytton enjoyed the advantage of Dr.
Richardson’s acquaintance, how much more sensibly he
would have set to work. The most popular passage in the
play would then, without a doubt, have run somewhat in
this style:&mdash;</p>

<p>Another burlesque was produced at the Gaiety Theatre,
London, in October 1878, entitled <cite>The Lady of Lyons
Married and Settled</cite>, by Herman C. Merivale, with Miss
Nelly Farren, and Messrs. Edward Terry, Royce, Maclean
and Squire, in the principal characters. In this, Claude Melnotte,
instead of describing an imaginary palace, sings a
patter song to his wife, <cite>Pauline</cite>, in praise of the Darwinian
theory of the evolution of species. As might be expected,
the humour of this is somewhat ponderous.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the efforts of these famous actors and
actresses the play had little success. When Sir E. L. Bulwer
published it, he attempted to excuse its comparative failure
by asserting that the critics had condemned the play from
a dislike of his political opinions, with other equally weak
statements, which Thackeray exposed and ridiculed in a

<p><span class="sc">Honrabble Barnet</span>!&mdash;Retired from the littery world
a year or moar, I didn’t think anything would injuice me
to come forrards again; for I was content with my share of
reputation, and propoas’d to add nothink to those immortial
wux which have rendered this Magaseen so sallybrated.</p>

<p>Shall I tell you the reazn of my re-appearants?&mdash;a desire
for the benefick of my fellow-creatures? Fiddlestick! A
mighty truth with which my busm laboured, and which I
must bring forth or die? Nonsince&mdash;stuff: money’s the
secret, my dear Barnet&mdash;-money&mdash;<em>L’argong, gelt, spicunia</em>.
Here’s quarter day coming, and I’m blest if I can pay my
landlud, unless I can ad hartificially to my inkum.</p>

<p>This is, however, betwigst you and me. There’s no need
to blacard the streets with it, or to tell the British public
that Fitzroy Y-ll-wpl-sh is short of money, or that the sallybrated
hauthor of the Y&mdash;&mdash; Papers is in peskewniary
difficklties, or is fiteagued by his shuperhuman littery labors
or by his famly suckmstansies, or by any other pusnal matter:
my maxim, dear B., is on these pints to be as quiet as
posbile. What the juice does the public care for you or
me? Why must we always, in prefizzes and what not, be
a-talking about ourselves and our igstrodnary merrats, woas,
and injaries? It is on this subjick that I porpies, my dear
Barnet, to speak to you in a frendly way; and praps you’ll
find my advise tolrabbly holesum.</p>

<p>We brew, and we love our own tap&mdash;amen; but the pint
betwigst us is this stewpid, absudd way of crying out,
because the public don’t like it too. Why shood they, my
dear Barnet? You may vow that they are fools; or that
the critix are your enemies; or that the wuld should judge
your poams by your critticle rules, and not their own: yon
may beat your breast, and vow you are a marter, and you
won’t mend the matter. Take heart, man! you’re not so
misrabble after all; your spirits need not be so <em>very</em> cast
down; you are not so <em>very</em> badly paid. I’d lay a wager
that you make, with one thing or another&mdash;plays, novvles,
pamphlicks, and little odd jobs here and there&mdash;your three
thowsnd a year. There’s many a man, dear Bullwig, that
works for less, and lives content. Why should’nt you?
Three thowsnd a year is no such bad thing&mdash;let alone the
barnetcy: it must be a great comfort to have that bloody
hand in your skitching.</p>

<p>Us littery men I take to be like a pack of schoolboys&mdash;childish,
greedy, envius, holding by our friends and always
ready to fight. What must be a man’s conduck among
such? He must either take no notis, and pass on myjastick,
or else turn round and pummle soundly&mdash;one, two, right and
left, ding dong over the face and eyes; above all, never
acknowledge that he is hurt. Years ago, for instans (we’ve
no ill-blood, but only mention this by way of igsample),
you began a sparring with this Magaseen. Law bless you,
such a ridicklus gaym I never see: a man so belaybord,
beflustered, bewolloped, was never known; it was the laff
of the whole town. Your intelackshal natur, respected
Barnet, is not fizzickly adapted, so to speak, for encounters
of this sort. You must not indulge in combats with us
course bullies of the press: you have not the <em>staminy</em> for a
reglar set-to. What, then, is your plan? In the midst of
the mob to pass as quiet as you can: you won’t be undistubbed.
Who is? Some stray kix and buffits will fall to
you&mdash;mortial man is subjick to such; but if you begin to
wins and cry out, and set up for a marter, wo betide you!</p>

<p>These remarks, pusnal as I confess them to be, are yet,
I assure you, written in perfick good-natur, and have
been inspired by your play of the <cite>Sea Capting</cite>, and prefiz
to it; which latter is on matters intirely pusnal, and will,
therefore, I trust, igscuse this kind of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad hominam</i> (as
they say) diskcushion. I propose, honrabble Barnit, to
cumsider calmly this play and prephiz, and to speak of
both with that honisty which, in the pantry or studdy,
I’ve been always phamous for. Let us, in the first
place, listen to the opening of the “Preface to the Fourth
Edition.”</p>

<p>Now, my dear sir, look what a pretty number of please
you put forrards here, why your play should’nt be good.</p>

<p>First. Good plays are almost always written by actors.</p>

<p>Secknd. You are a novice to the style of composition.</p>

<p>Third. You <em>may</em> be mistaken in your effects, being a
novelist by trade, and not a play-writer.</p>

<p>Fourthly. Your in such bad helth and sperrits.</p>

<p>Fifthly. Your so afraid of the critix that they damp
your arder.</p>

<p>For shame, for shame, man! What confeshns is these&mdash;what
painful pewling and piping! Your not a babby.
I take you to be some seven or eight and thutty years
old&mdash;“in the morning of youth,” as the flosofer says.
Don’t let any such nonsince take your reazn prisoner.
What you, an old hand amongst us&mdash;an old soldier of
our sovring quean the press&mdash;you, who have had the best
pay, have held the topmost rank (ay, and <em>deserved</em> them
too!&mdash;I gif you leaf to quot me in sasiaty, and say,
“I <em>am</em> a man of genius: Y-ll-wpl-sh says so”)&mdash;you to
lose heart and to cry pickavy, and begin to howl, because
little boys fling stones at you! Fie, man! take courage;
and, bearing the terrows of your blood-red hand, as the
poet says, punish us, if we’ve ofended you; punish us
like a man, or bear your own punishment like a man.
Don’t try to come off with such misrabble lodgic as that
above.</p>

<p>What do you? You give four satisfackary reazns that
the play is bad (the secknd is naught&mdash;for your no such
chicking at play-writing, this being the forth). You
show that the play must be bad, and <em>then</em> begin to deal
with the critix for finding folt!</p>

<p>Was there ever wuss generalship? The play <em>is</em> bad&mdash;your
right&mdash;a wuss I never see or read. But why kneed
<em>you</em> say so? If it was so <em>very</em> bad, why publish it?
<em>Because you wish to serve the drama!</em> O fie! don’t lay
that flattering function to your sole, as Milton observes.
<em>Do</em> you believe that this <em>Sea Capting</em> can serve the drama?
Did you never intend that it should serve anything, or
anybody <em>else</em>? Of cors you did! You wrote it for money&mdash;money
from the maniger, money from bookseller&mdash;for the
same reason that I write this. Sir, Shakespeare wrote for
the very same reasons, and I never heard that he bragged
about serving the drama. Away with this canting about
great motifs! let us not be too prowd, my dear Barnet,
and fansy ourselves marters of the truth, marters or
apostels. We are but tradesmen, working for bread, and
not for righteousness’ sake. Let’s try and work honestly;
but don’t let us be prayting pompisly about our “sacred
calling.” The taylor who makes your coats (and very well
they are made too, with the best of velvit collars)&mdash;I say
Stulze, or Nugee, might cry out that <em>their</em> motifs were
but to assert the eturnle truth of tayloring, with just as
much reasn; and who would belive them?</p>

<p>Your apinion about the actors I shan’t here meddle
with. They all acted exlently as far as my humbile
judgment goes, and your write in giving them all possible
<span class="pageno">227</span>
prays. But let’s consider the last sentence of the
prefiz, my dear Barnet, and see what a pretty set of
apiniuns you lay down.</p>

<p>1. The critix are your inymies in this age.</p>

<p>2. In the nex, however, you hope to find newmrous
frends.</p>

<p>3. And it’s a satisfackshn to think that, in spite of
politticle diffrances, you have found frendly aujences here.</p>

<p>My dear Barnet, <em>do</em> you suppose that <em>politticle diffrances</em>
prejudice pepple against <em>you</em>? What <em>are</em> your
politix! Wig, I presume&mdash;so are mine, <em>ontry noo</em>. And
what if they <em>are</em> Wig, or Raddiccle, or Cumsuvvative?
Does any mortial man in England care a phig for your
politix? Do you think yourself such a mity man in
parlymint that critix are to be angry with you, and
aujences to be cumsidered magnanamous because
they treat you fairly? There, now, was Sherridn, he
who roat the <em>Rifles</em> and <em>School for Scandle</em> ([ saw the
<em>Rifles</em> after your play, and O, Barnet, if you <em>knew</em> what
a relief it was!)&mdash;there, I say, was Sherridn&mdash;he <em>was</em> a
politticle character, if you please&mdash;he <em>could</em> make a spitch

<p>The fust spissymen has been going the round of all the
papers, as real, reglar poatry. Those wicked critix! they
must have been laffing in their sleafs when they quoted it.
Malody, suckling round and uppards from the bows, like a
happy soul released, hangs in the air, and from invizable
plumes shakes sweetness down. Mighty fine, truly! but

let mortial man tell the meanink of the passidge. Is it
<em>musickle</em> sweetniss that Malody shakes down from its
plumes&mdash;its wings, that is, or tail&mdash;or some pekewliar scent
that proceeds from happy souls released, and which they
shake down from the trees when they are suckling round
and uppards? <em>Is</em> this poatry, Barnet? Is it poatry, or
sheer windy humbugg, that sounds a little melojous, and
won’t bear the commanest test of common sence?</p>

<p>In passidge number 2, the same bisniss is going on,
though in a comprehensable way: the air, the leaves, the
otion, are fild with emocean at Capting Norman’s happiness.
Pore Nature is dragged in to partisapate in his joys,
just as she has been before. Once in a poem, this universle
simfithy is very well; but once is enuff, my dear
Barnet, and that once should be in some great suckumstans,
surely&mdash;such as the meeting of Adam and Eve, in
“Paradice Lost,” or Jewpeter and Jewno, in Hoamer,
where there seems, as it were, a reasn for it. But sea-captings
should not be eternly spowting and invoking gods,
hevns, starrs, angels, and other silestial influences. We can
all do it, Barnet; nothing in life is easier. I can compare
my livry buttons to the stars, or the clouds of my backopipe
to the dark vollums that ishew from Mount Hetna; or I can
say that angels are looking down from them, and the
tobacco silf, like a happy sole released, is circling round and
upwards, and shaking sweetness down. All this is as esy
as drink; but it’s not poatry, Barnet, nor natural. People,
when their mothers reckonize them, don’t howl about the
suckumambint air, and paws to think of the happy leaves
a-rustling&mdash;at least, one mistrusts them if they do. Take
another instans out of your own play. (Capting Norman,

<p>Very right, Miss Violet&mdash;the scentiment is natral, affeckshnit,
pleasing (it might have been in more grammaticle
languidge, and no harm done); but never mind, the feeling
is pritty, and I can fancy, my dear Barnet, a pritty,
smiling, weeping lass, looking up in a man’s face and
saying it. But the capting!&mdash;oh, this capting!-this
windy, spouting captain, with his prittinesses, and conseated
apollogies for the hardness of his busm, and his
old, stale, vapid simalies, and his wishes to be a bee!
Pish! <em>Men</em> don’t make love in this finniking way. It’s
the part of a sentymentle, poeticle taylor, not a galliant
gentleman, in command of one of her Madjisty’s vessels of
war.</p>

<p>Take my advise, honrabble sir&mdash;listen to a humble
footmin; it’s generally best in poatry to understand puffickly
what you mean yourself, and to igspress your
meaning clearly afterwoods&mdash;in the simpler words the
better, praps. You may, for instans, call a coronet a
coronal, if you like, as you might call a hat a “swart
sombrero,” “a glossy four-and-nine,” “a silken helm, to
storm impermeable, and lightsome as the breezy gossamer;”
but, in the long run, it’s as well to call it a hat.
It <em>is</em> a hat, and that name is quite as poetticle as another.

I think it’s Playto, or els Harrystottle, who observes that
what we call a rose by any other name would smell as
sweet. Confess, now, dear Barnet, don’t you long to call
it a Polyanthus?</p>

<p>I never see a play more carelessly written. In such a
hurry you seem to have bean, that you have actually in
some sentences forgot to put in the sence. What is this,
for instance?</p>

<p class="p2">Probably no serious literary production had ever before
received such a severe castigation as was contained in this
burlesque of criticism, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mais c’est la ridicule qui tue</i>.
Bulwer was a vain, sensitive man, keenly alive to hostile
criticism, and morbidly afraid of being laughed at.</p>

<p>He tried, by every means in his power, to suppress the
printed copies of <cite>The Sea Captain</cite>, it is now very scarce, and
a single copy has been sold for as much as ten pounds.</p>

<p>Many years later Lord Lytton remodelled the play, and
under the new title of <cite>The Rightful Heir</cite> it was produced
at the Lyceum Theatre, London, on October 3, 1868, but
it was only moderately successful, and has never been
since revived. The part of the hero, renamed <cite>Vyvian</cite>,
was performed by Mr. Bandmann, an actor chiefly remarkable
for his strong German accent, and for his great profusion
of woolly-looking hair. The play was generally pronounced
dreary and tedious, and the acting commonplace,
with the one exception of the very fine impersonation of Sir
Grey de Malpas by Mr. Hermann Vezin. A burlesque was
inevitable, and seizing upon Mr. Bandmann’s personal
peculiarity, it was christened <cite>The Frightful Hair</cite>; <cite>or, Who
Shot the Dog</cite>? This was written by Mr. F. C. Burnand, and
produced at the Haymarket Theatre, under the management
of Mr. J. B. Buckstone, on December 26th, 1868, with the
following strong cast:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="">
<tr><td class="left pad7">Vyvian (with a tremendous wig),</td>
    <td class="left pad7">Mr. Kendal.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left pad7">Lord Beaufort</td>
    <td class="left pad7">Miss. F. Gwynn.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left pad7">Sir Grey de Malpas</td>
    <td class="left pad7">Mr. Compton.</td></tr>

    <td class="left pad7">Miss Ione Burke.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left pad7">Eveline</td>
    <td class="left pad7">Miss F. Wright.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Those who saw this humorous production will not have

forgotten the dry, quiet drollery of the late Mr. Compton,
or the admirable manner in which Mr. Kendal mimicked
Bandmann.</p>

<p>Another burlesque was written by Mr. H. T. Arden,
entitled “<cite>The Right-Fall Heir</cite>; or, the Sea-rover and the
Fall over,” but the printed copy does not mention when, or
at what theatre, this burlesque was produced.</p>

<p>“The Very Last Days of Pompeii!” Being a complete
<em>Bulwer-sement</em> of the classic drama, by R. Reece, was produced
at the Vaudeville Theatre, London, on February
13th, 1872, with Miss Nelly Power, David James, and
Thomas Thorne in the leading parts. This, of course, was
founded on Lytton’s novel “The Last Days of Pompeii,”
but contains no passages which can be quoted as parodies of
the original.</p>

<p class="drop-img">
<span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_t_alt.png"

 alt="T" /></span>
<span class="sc">here</span> has lately been considerable controversy
as to the date, and place of
birth of Mrs. Browning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Richmond-Ritchie, in the “Dictionary
of National Biography,” states that Mrs.
Browning “was born at Burn Hall, <em>Durham</em>, on
March 6, 1809,” whilst Mr. J. H. Ingram in a
brief memoir prefixed to the “Poetical Works
of E. B. Browning” (Ward, Lock and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>,
London) asserts that Elizabeth Barrett Barrett
was the eldest daughter of Edward Moulton
Barrett, and was born in <em>London</em> on Saturday,
March 4, 1809, as shown by an announcement
in a contemporary newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Browning contradicts both these
statements, in a prefatory note to a small volume
of his late wife’s poems, published by Smith
Elder and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> in 1887. He contends that she
was born on March 6, 1806, at Carlton Hall,
Durham, the residence of her father’s brother,
and that she had an elder sister, who died in
childhood. This statement is the more peculiar
as Mr. Browning had previously written to Mr.
<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pageno">229</span>
Ingram (in 1886) “I engaged to verify any
dates Mrs. Ritchie furnished, and I did so.
<em>Only those are to be depended upon.</em>” Yet it is
clearly impossible that both Mrs. Ritchie and
Mr. Browning can be correct, and it seems
very probable that both are mistaken. <cite>The
Athenæum</cite>, February 4, 1888, published a letter
from Mr. Ingram in answer to Mr. Browning’s
<cite>Note</cite>, showing, firstly, that there is no such
place as Carlton Hall, Durham, nor any record
of Mrs. E. B. Browning’s birth in that city;
secondly, that the newspaper announcement of
the birth stated “London, <cite>March</cite> 4, 1809, the
wife of Edward M. Barrett, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, of a daughter,”
so that it was obviously impossible for that
lady also to have given birth to a daughter at
Burn Hall, Durham, on <cite>March</cite> 6, 1809, as stated
by Mrs. Ritchie; and thirdly, that as in 1806
Mr. Barrett was a student in Cambridge, and
only about twenty years of age, it was unlikely
that he would then be the father of two children,
(as Mr. Browning asserts), although it is admitted
he married early. To this letter Mr.
Browning briefly replied, disclaiming any “certitude
in the matter from knowledge of his own,”
which reads like a tacit admission of the
accuracy of Mr. J. H. Ingram’s statements.</p>

<p>That there should be some doubt about an
event which occurred eighty years ago can be
readily understood, but it is difficult to explain
the discrepancies which exist in several descriptions
of Mrs. Browning’s personal appearance,
thus Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“It is wonderful to see how small she is, how pale her
cheek, how bright and <em>dark her eyes</em>. There is not such
another figure in the world; and her <em>black ringlets</em> cluster
down on her neck, and make her face look the whiter by
their sable profusion.”</p>

<p>Two other observers give very different
details:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“But it was Mrs. Browning’s face upon which one loved
to gaze&mdash;that face and head which almost lost themselves
in the <em>thick curls of her dark brown</em> hair.... Her
large, <em>brown eyes</em> were beautiful, and were, in truth, the
windows of her soul. They combined the confidingness
of a child with the poet-passion of heart and intellect;
and in gazing into them it was easy to read why Mrs.
Browning wrote.” <span class="sc">Kate Field</span>, 1861, “<cite>Letter from
Florence</cite>.”&mdash;<cite>Atlantic Monthly, September.</cite></p>

<p class="blockquote">“She was slight and fragile in appearance, with a pale,
wasted face, shaded by <em>masses of soft chestnut curls</em> which
fell on her cheeks, and serious <em>eyes of bluish-gray</em>. Her
frame seemed to be altogether disproportionate to her
soul.”&mdash;<span class="sc">Bayard Taylor</span>, “<cite>At Home and Abroad</cite>.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Browning’s poetry, though highly
praised by critics and literary men, has not yet
attained that popularity which engenders many
parodies, being, as Charlotte Brontë wrote,
somewhat wordy, intricate and obscure.</p>

<p>“To look at these half-starved children in London Schools
is to be ‘full of pity.’ Very touching is it to think of the
quiet heroism with which, when hunger is gnawing within
and the dull misery of want overflows them, they sit uncomplaining
at their little desks, toiling at their allotted tasks,
wondering, no doubt, sometimes what it all means, but

<p>“Gus Harris has got Shuttleworth, or Pennington, or some
other reverend gentleman, to write him a letter about the
sad condition of the children of the poorer clergy, who are
in worse plight than the thousands who recently attended
Drury Lane from the national and orphan schools and
asylums, seeing that they are never invited to witness a
pantomime. Quite ready with his response was Gussy, who
has now issued an invitation for Thursday morning next to
‘the families of curates and ministers of all denominations
who are not in a position to pay for seats.’”</p>

<div class="i1">Do you hear those children weeping, O my brothers?</div>
<div class="i2">They’re poor parsons’ little dears!</div>
<div class="i1">They want to go to theatres, like the others,</div>
<div class="i2">And hence their trickling tears.</div>
<div class="i1">All the ragged-schools have seen the clown’s hot <span class="lock">poker&mdash;</span></div>
<div class="i2">They have watched him steal the sausages with zest,</div>
<div class="i1">They have seen his face all bismuth and red ochre,</div>
<div class="i2">They have seen the fairies beautifully dressed.</div>
<div class="i1">But the children of our clergymen, my brothers,</div>
<div class="i2">Are “boo-hooing” bitterlee,</div>
<div class="i1">They want to see a panto, like the others,</div>
<div class="i2">And they want to go in free.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Did you read that parson’s letter&mdash;full of sorrow&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Which described these children’s woe?</div>
<div class="i1">Did you see who tried publicity to borrow</div>
<div class="i2">From that note&mdash;not long ago?</div>
<div class="i1">’Twas written by a well-known London preacher</div>
<div class="i2">(For parsons Harris seems to have a craze),</div>
<div class="i1">And that letter told of many a little creature</div>
<div class="i2">Whose pa is much too poor to go to plays.</div>
<div class="i1">That parson said <em>his</em> youngster&mdash;O my brothers!&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Had complained in accents grim</div>
<div class="i1">That, though he was as poor as lots of others,</div>
<div class="i2">No lessee invited him.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“We are worse off than the children from the alleys”</div>
<div class="i2">(Thus the parson’s weeping boy);</div>
<div class="i1">“They can go in free and see the ‘spills’ and ‘rallies,’</div>
<div class="i2">And the fairies&mdash;ah, what joy!</div>
<div class="i1">They give these children buns, and even verses,”</div>
<div class="i2">Said the parson’s child (or words to this effect),</div>
<div class="i1">“But our pa’s have little money in their purses”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">“Which, alas!” exclaims that parson, “is correct.</div>
<div class="i1">&mdash;&mdash;Then have pity, Mr. Harris, on the children</div>
<div class="i2">Of all parsons short of cash.”</div>
<div class="i1">(Mrs. Browning for a rhyme here has “bewildering”</div>
<div class="i2">But for <em>me</em> that’s much too rash.)</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then lo! in striking “ads,” said Gus, “With pleasure!</div>
<div class="i2">Those servants of the Church&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Who have children thus lamenting beyond measure&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">I will <em>not</em> leave in the lurch!</div>
<div class="i1">All ministers who’re not in a position</div>
<div class="i2">To pay for seats my pantomime to see,</div>
<div class="i1">Shall anon to Drury Lane have free admission,</div>
<div class="i2">If they send in full particulars to me.”</div>
<div class="i1">Such as (probably) their date of ordination,</div>
<div class="i2">And what their “plates” collect;</div>
<div class="i1">And if they have their bishop’s approbation;</div>
<div class="i2">And if “chapel,” of what sect?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Thus Harris, in a patronising fashion,</div>
<div class="i2">And all by way of trade,</div>
<div class="i1">On the offspring of the clergy takes compassion,</div>
<div class="i2">And essays the Church to aid.</div>
<div class="i1">Such a splendid chance was not to be rejected&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">It would make a grand advertisement, forsooth!&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And probably young Harris recollected</div>
<div class="i2">That to parsons he owed puffs for “Pluck” and “Youth.”</div>
<div class="i1">But what about that clergyman’s suggestion</div>
<div class="i2">To the Lessee of the Lane?</div>
<div class="i1">Was it written (Gussy, please excuse the question)</div>
<div class="i2">By friend Pennington again?</div>

<p>Shelley’s poetry has not been extensively parodied, nor
have his prose writings been burlesqued, unless, indeed, the
forged letters published in 1852 by Mr. Edward Moxon,
London, may be considered in the light of a burlesque.
This little volume was entitled “Letters of Percy Bysshe
Shelley, with an Introductory Essay by Robert Browning.”
The essay, dated “Paris, December 4th, 1851,” occupies 44

<p>This was one of the most ingenious literary forgeries of
modern times, so clever, not only in its imitation of handwriting,
but in style and circumstances, as to have deceived
the very elect.</p>

<p>The genuineness of the letters was first called in question
by Mr. F. T. Palgrave, who saw the book at Lord (then
Mr.) Tennyson’s house, and accidentally opened it at a
passage which he recognised as taken from an article contributed
by his father to the “Quarterly Review.” Other
tests were then applied, the post marks were carefully
examined, and little by little the network of fraud was
unravelled.</p>

<p>In February, March, and April, 1852, a great controversy,
concerning these letters, was carried on in literary circles,
but it was practically decided by a series of articles published
in the <cite>Athenæum</cite>, that they were forgeries.</p>

<p>The book was rigidly suppressed, and as only a few
copies had got abroad, it now very rarely occurs for sale.</p>

<p>In 1886, the Shelley Society produced Shelley’s gloomy
tragedy “The Cenci,” at the Grand Theatre, Islington,
when they also issued printed copies of the tragedy containing
the revolting “Relation of the Death of the Family
of the Cenci,” which Shelley had suppressed. For this
offence against decency, and good taste, the Shelley Society
was severely reproved by the press, and <cite>Truth</cite>, May 13,
1886, contained a satirical poem, entitled</p>

<div class="i1">A sensitive “freak” in a museum stood,</div>
<div class="i1">Where the hours were short and the salary good;</div>
<div class="i1">He was tattooed red, white, and blue,</div>
<div class="i1">He was the “Bearded Lady,” too,</div>
<div class="i1">Likewise the skeleton tall and thin,</div>
<div class="i1">And he boasted a most elastic skin:</div>
<div class="i1">He’d grown his feet to abnormal size,</div>
<div class="i1">And whitened his hair Albino wise,</div>
<div class="i1">So he said in language plain and bold</div>
<div class="i1">That when <em>he</em> was abandoned the day’d be cold!</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Yet he was unhappy exhibiting there,</div>
<div class="i1">For down in his breast lurked a poignant care.</div>
<div class="i1">He suffered deeply and oft because</div>
<div class="i1">He wanted to be far more than he was;</div>
<div class="i1">His sensitive nature could not brook</div>
<div class="i1">That the public at anyone else should look.</div>
<div class="i1"><em>He</em> wanted to be the “Leopard Boy,”</div>
<div class="i1">And the “Phantom Lady” cold and coy,</div>
<div class="i1">The wonderful “Glass-devouring Star”</div>
<div class="i1">And the fair “Circassian,” from Mullingar!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He hated the sinuous “Human Snakes,”</div>

<div class="i1">He punched the “What Is it?” in the head,</div>
<div class="i1">And cut the “Capillary Sisters” dead;</div>
<div class="i1">Placed the “Midget” under the ban</div>
<div class="i1">And wouldn’t shake feet with the “Armless Man”;</div>
<div class="i1">Kicked the “Cannibal” out of his road,</div>

<div class="i1">And they said, as they washed off the gay tattoo,</div>
<div class="i1">And hung up his beard where the wind blew through,</div>
<div class="i1">That it was amazing he should be dead.</div>

<p class="p2 center larger">ADDRESS TO AN EGYPTIAN MUMMY
IN BELZONI’S EXHIBITION.</p>

<p>The success of the ancient Egyptians in preserving their
dead by the operation of embalming was surprisingly great.
For a proof of this we have only to turn to the fact of our
viewing at this day the bodies of persons who lived three
thousand years since. This ingenious people applied the
powers of art to the purposes of their religion, and did all
they could to keep the human frame entire after death,
fondly thinking that if it proved a fit dwelling, its former
inhabitant, the soul, would return at some distant period,
and animate it afresh, even upon earth.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">And thou hast walked about, (how strange a story!)</div>
<div class="i2">In Thebes’s street three thousand years ago;</div>
<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><span class="pageno">237</span>
<div class="i1">When the Memnonium was in all its glory,</div>
<div class="i2">And time had not begun to overthrow</div>
<div class="i1">Those temples, palaces, and piles stupendous,</div>
<div class="i1">Of which the very ruins are tremendous.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Speak! for thou long enough hast acted dummy,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Thou hast a tongue, come, let us hear its tune;</div>
<div class="i1">Thou’rt standing on thy legs, above ground, Mummy!</div>
<div class="i2">Revisiting the glimpses of the moon,</div>
<div class="i1">Not like thin ghosts or disembodied creatures,</div>
<div class="i1">But with thy bones, and flesh, and limbs, and features.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Tell us, for doubtless thou canst recollect,</div>
<div class="i2">To whom should we assign the Sphinx’s fame;</div>
<div class="i1">Was Cheops or Cephrenes architect,</div>
<div class="i2">Of either pyramid that bears his name?</div>
<div class="i1">Is Pompey’s Pillar really a misnomer?</div>
<div class="i1">Had Thebes a hundred gates, as sung by Homer?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Perhaps thou wert a mason, and forbidden,</div>
<div class="i2">By oath to tell the mysteries of thy trade:</div>
<div class="i1">Then say what secret melody was hidden</div>
<div class="i2">In Memnon’s statue which at sunrise played?</div>
<div class="i1">Perhaps thou wert a priest, and hast been dealing</div>
<div class="i1">In human blood, and horrors past revealing.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Perchance that very hand, now pinioned flat,</div>
<div class="i2">Has hob-a-nobbed with Pharaoh, glass to glass;</div>
<div class="i1">Or dropped a halfpenny in Homer’s hat,</div>
<div class="i2">Or dofted thine own to let Queen Dido pass,</div>
<div class="i1">Or held, by Solomon’s own invitation,</div>
<div class="i1">A torch at the great Temple’s dedication.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I need not ask thee if that hand, when armed,</div>
<div class="i2">Has any Roman soldier mauled or knuckled,</div>
<div class="i1">For thou wert dead and buried, and embalmed,</div>
<div class="i2">Ere Romulus and Remus had been suckled!</div>
<div class="i1">Antiquity appears to have begun,</div>
<div class="i1">Long after thy primeval race was run.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Thou could’st develop, if that withered tongue</div>
<div class="i2">Might tell us, what those sightless orbs have seen,</div>
<div class="i1">How the world looked when it was fresh and young,</div>
<div class="i2">And the great Deluge still had left it green;</div>
<div class="i1">Or was it then so old, that History’s pages</div>
<div class="i1">Contained no record of its early ages?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Still silent, incommunicative elf!</div>
<div class="i2">Art sworn to secrecy? then keep thy vows;</div>
<div class="i1">But prithee tell us something of thyself,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Reveal the secrets of thy prison-house!</div>
<div class="i1">Since in the world of spirits thou hast slumbered,</div>
<div class="i1">What thou hast seen, what strange adventures numbered?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Since first thy form was in this box extended,</div>
<div class="i2">We have, above ground, seen some strange mutations;</div>
<div class="i1">The Roman empire has begun and ended,</div>
<div class="i2">New worlds have risen, we have lost old nations,</div>
<div class="i1">And countless kings have into dust been humbled,</div>
<div class="i1">While not a fragment of thy flesh has crumbled.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Didst thou not hear the pother o’er thy head,</div>
<div class="i2">When the great Persian conqueror, Cambyses,</div>
<div class="i1">Marched armies o’er thy tomb with thundering tread,</div>
<div class="i2">O’erthrew Osiris, Orus, Apis, Isis,</div>
<div class="i1">And shook the Pyramids with fear and wonder,</div>
<div class="i1">When the gigantic Memnon fell asunder?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">If the tomb’s secrets may not be confessed,</div>
<div class="i2">The nature of thy private life unfold:</div>
<div class="i1">A heart has throbbed beneath that leathern breast,</div>
<div class="i2">And tears adown that dusty cheek have rolled.</div>
<div class="i1">Have children climbed those knees, and kissed that face?</div>
<div class="i1">What was thy name and station, age and race?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Statue of flesh&mdash;Immortal of the dead!</div>
<div class="i2">Imperishable type of evanescence!</div>
<div class="i1">Posthumous man, who quitt’st thy narrow bed,</div>
<div class="i2">And standest undecayed within our presence,</div>
<div class="i1">Thou wilt hear nothing till the Judgment-morning,</div>
<div class="i1">When the great Trump shall thrill thee with its warning!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Why should this worthless tegument endure,</div>
<div class="i2">If its undying guests be lost for ever?</div>
<div class="i1">Oh, let us keep the <em>soul embalmed and pure</em></div>
<div class="i2"><em>In living virtue</em>; that, when both must sever,</div>
<div class="i1">Although corruption may our frame consume,</div>
<div class="i1">Th’ immortal spirit in the skies may bloom!</div>

<div class="i1">On her feet so bare, and her tattered gown.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Thanks! said the judge, a sweeter draught</div>
<div class="i1">From a fairer hand was never quaffed.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He spoke of the grass, and flowers, and trees,</div>
<div class="i1">Of the singing birds, and the humming bees;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then talked of the haying, and wondered whether</div>
<div class="i1">The cloud in the west would bring foul weather.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And Maud forgot her briar torn gown,</div>
<div class="i1">And her graceful ankles bare and brown;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And listened, while a pleased surprise</div>
<div class="i1">Looked from her long-lashed hazel eyes.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">At last, like one who for delay</div>
<div class="i1">Seeks a vain excuse, he rode away.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Maud Müller looked and sighed&mdash;“Ah me!</div>
<div class="i1">That I the judge’s bride might be!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“He would dress me up in silks so fine,</div>
<div class="i1">And praise and toast me at his wine.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“My father should wear a broadcloth coat;</div>
<div class="i1">My brother should sail a painted boat.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“I’d dress my mother so grand and gay,</div>
<div class="i1">And the baby should have a new toy each day.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“And I’d feed the hungry and clothe the poor,</div>
<div class="i1">And all should bless me who left our door.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The judge looked back as he climbed the hill,</div>
<div class="i1">And saw Maud Müller standing still.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“A form more fair, a face more sweet,</div>
<div class="i1">Ne’er hath it been my lot to meet.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“And her modest answer and graceful air,</div>
<div class="i1">Show her wise and good as she is fair.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Would she were mine, and I to-day,</div>
<div class="i1">Like her, a harvester of hay.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“No doubtful balance of rights and wrongs,</div>
<div class="i1">And weary lawyers with endless tongues,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“But low of cattle and song of birds,</div>
<div class="i1">And health of quiet and loving words.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But he thought of his sisters, proud and cold,</div>
<div class="i1">And his mother, vain of her rank and gold.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So, closing his heart, the judge rode on,</div>
<div class="i1">And Maude was left in the field alone.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But the lawyers smiled that afternoon,</div>
<div class="i1">When he hummed in court an old love tune;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And the young girl mused beside the well,</div>
<div class="i1">Till the rain on the unraked clover fell.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He wedded a wife of richest dower,</div>
<div class="i1">Who lived for fashion as he for power.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Yet oft, in his marble hearth’s bright glow,</div>
<div class="i1">He watched a picture come and go;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And sweet Maud Müller’s hazel eyes</div>
<div class="i1">Looked out in their innocent surprise.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pageno">240</span>
<div class="i1">Oft when the wine in his glass was red,</div>
<div class="i1">He longed for the wayside well instead;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And closed his eyes on the garnished rooms,</div>
<div class="i1">To dream of meadows and clover blooms.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And the proud man sighed with a secret pain;</div>
<div class="i1">“Ah, that I were free again!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Free as when I rode that day,</div>
<div class="i1">Where the barefoot maiden raked her hay.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">She wedded a man unlearned and poor,</div>
<div class="i1">And many children played round her door.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But care and sorrow, and child-birth pain,</div>
<div class="i1">Left their traces on heart and brain.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And oft when the summer sun shone hot</div>
<div class="i1">On the new-mown hay in the meadow lot,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And she heard the little spring-brook fall</div>
<div class="i1">Over the roadside through the wall,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">In the shade of the apple-tree again</div>
<div class="i1">She saw a rider draw his rein;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And, gazing down with timid grace,</div>
<div class="i1">She felt his pleased eyes read her face.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Sometimes her narrow kitchen walls</div>
<div class="i1">Stretched away into stately halls;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The weary wheel to a spinnit turned,</div>
<div class="i1">The tallow candle an astral burned;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And for him who sat by the chimney lug.</div>
<div class="i1">Dozing and grumbling o’er pipe and mug,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A manly form at her side she saw,</div>
<div class="i1">And joy was duty, and love was law.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then she took up her burden of life again</div>
<div class="i1">Saying only “It might have been!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Alas! for maiden, alas! for judge,</div>
<div class="i1">For rich repiner and household drudge!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">God pity them both! and pity us all,</div>
<div class="i1">Who vainly the dreams of youth recall,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For of all sad words of tongue or pen</div>
<div class="i1">The saddest are these “It might have been!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Ah, well! for us all some sweet hope lies</div>
<div class="i1">Deeply buried from human eyes;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<p>Mr. Whittier’s statement of the origin of his poem of
“Maud Müller” is thus given. He was driving with his
sister through York, U.S.A., and stopped at a harvest
field to inquire the way. A young girl raking hay near
the stone-wall stopped to answer their inquiries. Whittier
noticed as she talked that she bashfully raked the hay
around and over her bare feet, and she was fresh and
fair. The little incident left its impression, and he wrote
out the poem that very evening. “But if I had had any
idea,” he said, “that the plaguey little thing would have
been so liked, I should have taken more pains with it.”
To the inquiry as to the title, Maud Müller, he said it was
suggested to him, and was not a selection. It came as the
poem came. But he gives it the short German pronunciation,
as Meuler, not the broad Yankee, Muller.</p>

<div class="poemdivider">[<span class="decoration">Being the only genuine sequel to “Maud Müller.”</span>]</div>
<div class="i1">Maud Müller, all that summer day,</div>
<div class="i1">Raked the meadow sweet with hay;</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Yet, looking down the distant lane,</div>
<div class="i1">She hoped the judge would come again.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But when he came, with smile and bow,</div>
<div class="i1">Maud only blushed, and stammered, “Ha-ow?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And spoke of her “pa,” and wondered whether</div>
<div class="i1">He’d give consent they should wed together.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Old Müller burst in tears, and then</div>
<div class="i1">Begged that the judge would lend him “ten;”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For trade was dull and wages low,</div>
<div class="i1">And the “craps,” this year, were somewhat slow.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And ere the languid summer died,</div>
<div class="i1">Sweet Maud became the Judge’s bride.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But, on the day that they were mated,</div>
<div class="i1">Maud’s brother Bob was intoxicated;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And Maud’s relations, twelve in all,</div>
<div class="i1">Were very drunk at the judge’s hall.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And when the summer came again,</div>
<div class="i1">The young bride bore him babies twain.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And the judge was blest, but thought it strange</div>
<div class="i1">That bearing children made such a change:</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For Maud grew broad and red and stout:</div>
<div class="i1">And the waist that his arm once clasped about</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Was more than he now could span. And he</div>
<div class="i1">Sighed as he pondered, ruefully,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">How that which in Maud was native grace</div>
<div class="i1">In Mrs. Jenkins was out of place;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And thought of the twins, and wished that they</div>
<div class="i1">Looked less like the man who raked the hay</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">On Müller’s farm, and dreamed with pain</div>
<div class="i1">Of the day he wandered down the lane.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And, looking down that dreary track,</div>
<div class="i1">He half regretted that he came back.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For, had he waited, he might have wed</div>
<div class="i1">Some maiden fair and thoroughbred;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For there be women fair as she,</div>
<div class="i1">Whose verbs and nouns do more agree.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Alas for maiden! alas for judge!</div>
<div class="i1">And the sentimental,&mdash;that’s one-half “fudge;”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For Maud soon thought the judge a bore,</div>
<div class="i1">With all his learning and all his lore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And the judge would have bartered Maud’s fair face</div>
<div class="i1">For more refinement and social grace.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">If, of all words of tongue and pen,</div>
<div class="i1">The saddest are, “It might have been,”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">More sad are these we daily see:</div>

<div class="i1">Kate Ketchem on a winter’s night</div>
<div class="i1">Went to a party dressed in white.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Her chignon in a net of gold</div>
<div class="i1">Was about as large as they ever sold.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Gayly she went because her “pap”</div>
<div class="i1">Was supposed to be a rich old chap.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But when by chance her glances fell</div>
<div class="i1">On a friend who had lately married well,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Her spirits sunk and a vague unrest</div>
<div class="i1">And a nameless longing filled her breast.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pageno">241</span>
<div class="i1">A wish she would’nt have made known</div>
<div class="i1">To have an establishment of her own.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Tom Fudge came slowly through the throng</div>
<div class="i1">With chestnut hair worn pretty long.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He saw Kate Ketchem in the crowd</div>
<div class="i1">And knowing her slightly stopped, and bowed.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then asked her to give him a single flower</div>
<div class="i1">Saying he’d think it a priceless dower.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Out from those with which she was decked</div>
<div class="i1">She took the poorest she could select.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And, blushed as she gave it, looking down</div>
<div class="i1">To call attention to her gown.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Thanks,” said Fudge, and he thought how dear</div>
<div class="i1">Flowers must be at that time of year.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then several charming remarks he made</div>
<div class="i1">Asked if she sang, or danced, or played.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And being exhausted, inquired whether</div>
<div class="i1">She thought it was going to be pleasant weather.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And Kate displayed her “jewelry”</div>
<div class="i1">And dropped her lashes becomingly.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And listened with no attempt to disguise</div>
<div class="i1">The admiration in her eyes.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">At last like one who has nothing to say</div>
<div class="i1">He turned around, and walked away.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Kate Ketchem smiled, and said “you bet</div>
<div class="i1">I’ll catch that Fudge, and his money yet.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“He’s rich enough to keep me in clothes</div>
<div class="i1">And I think I could manage him as I chose.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“He could aid my father as well as not,</div>
<div class="i1">And buy my brother a splendid yacht.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“My mother for money should never fret</div>
<div class="i1">And all it cried for the baby should get.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“And after that with what he could spare</div>
<div class="i1">I’d make a show at a charity fair.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Tom Fudge looked back as he crossed the sill</div>
<div class="i1">And saw Kate Ketchem standing still.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“A girl more suited to my mind</div>
<div class="i1">It isn’t an easy thing to find;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“And everything she has to wear</div>
<div class="i1">Proves her as rich as she is fair.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Would she were mine, and I to day</div>
<div class="i1">Had the old man’s cash my debts to pay.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“No creditors with a long account</div>
<div class="i1">No tradesmen wanting ‘that little amount.’</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“But all my scores paid up when due</div>
<div class="i1">By a father-in-law as rich as a Jew.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But he thought of her brother not worth a straw</div>
<div class="i1">And her mother, that would be his, in law.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So undecided he walked along</div>
<div class="i1">And Kate was left alone in the throng.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But a lawyer smiled when he sought by stealth</div>
<div class="i1">To ascertain old Ketchem’s wealth.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And as for Kate she schemed and planned</div>
<div class="i1">Till one of the dancers claimed her hand.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He married her for her father’s cash,</div>
<div class="i1">She married him to cut a dash.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But as to paying his debts do you know</div>
<div class="i1">The father couldn’t see it so;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And at hints for help Kate’s hazel eyes</div>
<div class="i1">Looked out in their innocent surprise.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And when Tom thought of the way he had wed</div>
<div class="i1">He longed for a single life instead.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And closed his eyes in a sulky mood</div>
<div class="i1">Regretting the days of his bachelorhood.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And said in a sort of reckless vein,</div>
<div class="i1">“I’d like to see her catch me again.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“If I were free as on that night</div>
<div class="i1">When I saw Kate Ketchem dressed in white.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">She wedded him to be rich and gay</div>
<div class="i1">But husband and children did’nt pay.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He wasn’t the prize she hoped to draw</div>
<div class="i1">And would’nt live with his mother-in-law.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And oft when she had to coax and pout</div>
<div class="i1">In order to get him to take her out,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">She thought how very attentive and bright</div>
<div class="i1">He seemed at the party that winter’s night.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Of his laugh as soft as a breeze of the south</div>
<div class="i1">(’Twas now on the other side of his mouth);</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">How he praised her dress, and gems, in his talk</div>
<div class="i1">As he took a careful account of stock.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Sometimes she hated the very walls&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Hated her friends, her dinners, and calls.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Till her weak affection to hatred turned</div>
<div class="i1">Like a dying tallow candle burned.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And for him who sat there her peace to mar,</div>
<div class="i1">Smoking his everlasting cigar.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He wasn’nt the man she thought she saw</div>
<div class="i1">And grief was duty, and hate was law.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So she took up her burden with a groan</div>
<div class="i1">Saying only “I might have known.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Alas for Kate, and alas for Fudge,</div>
<div class="i1">Though I do not owe them any grudge.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And, alas, for any who find to their shame</div>
<div class="i1">That two can play at their little game.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For of all hard things to bear and grin</div>
<div class="i1">The hardest is knowing you’re taken in.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Ah! well as a general thing we fret</div>
<div class="i1">About the one we didn’t get.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But I think we need’nt make a fuss</div>

<div class="i1">Maud Müller worked at making hay</div>
<div class="i1">And cleared her forty cents a day.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Her clothes were coarse, but her health was fine,</div>
<div class="i1">And so she worked in the sweet sunshine&mdash;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Singing as glad as a bird in May</div>
<div class="i1">“Barbary Allen” the livelong day.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">She often glanced at the far off town</div>
<div class="i1">And wondered if eggs were up, or down.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And the sweet song died of a strange disease</div>
<div class="i1">Leaving a phantom-taste of cheese,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And an appetite and a nameless ache</div>
<div class="i1">For soda-water, and ginger cake.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The Judge rode slowly into view&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Stopped his horse in the shade, and threw</div>

<div class="i1">Maud Müller on an August day</div>
<div class="i1">Took the Fever of the Hay,</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Sneezing she went and her shrill Ah-chee</div>
<div class="i1">The mock-bird echoed from the tree.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The Judge rode slowly down the lane</div>
<div class="i1">Smoothing his chestnut horse’s mane,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And drew his bridle in the shade</div>
<div class="i1">With a stimulation to greet the maid.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He spoke of the grass, and flowers, and trees,</div>
<div class="i1">The pollen from which makes sufferers sneeze,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And Maudie forgot her swollen nose</div>
<div class="i1">And even her graceful bare brown toes,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And listened while a pleased surprise</div>
<div class="i1">Looked from her watering hazel eyes.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">At last with a wild “Ah-chee! Ah-cha!</div>
<div class="i1">Ah-choo! Ah-choo!” he rode away.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Maud Müller looked and sneezed “Ah-chee!</div>
<div class="i1">That I the Judge’s bride might be!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He would dress me with silks and diamond rings</div>
<div class="i1">And take me up to the ‘White Mountings,’</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And I’d use the finest cambric <em>mouchoir</em></div>
<div class="i1">And never have the Hay Fever more.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The Judge looked back as he climbed the hill</div>
<div class="i1">And heard her sternutations shrill.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Would she were mide, and I to-day</div>
<div class="i1">Rid of this dab Fever of the Hay.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But he thought of her sisters and clearly saw</div>
<div class="i1">Her mother would be his mother-in-law.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The baby would smear his broadcloth coat</div>
<div class="i1">And her brother borrow a five dollar note;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So closing his heart the Judge rode on</div>
<div class="i1">And Maudie was left in the field alone.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But the lawyers smiled that afternoon</div>
<div class="i1">When they heard him lustily a-choo-in.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And the young girl sneezed beside the well</div>
<div class="i1">Till the rain on the unraked clover fell.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He wedded a wife of richest dower</div>
<div class="i1">With an aquiline beak of ten Roman power,</div>

<div class="i1">And oft when the wine in his nose was red</div>
<div class="i1">And he knew the old woman was safe in bed,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The proud man sighed with a furnace force</div>
<div class="i1">“Ah could I only get a divorce</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And marry the girl I saw that day</div>
<div class="i1">When I had the Fever of the Hay.”</div>

<div class="i1">And oft when the summer sun shone hot</div>
<div class="i1">She wished she could drown the pesky lot.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Again in the shade of the apple trees</div>
<div class="i1">She saw a rider draw rein, and sneeze,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">As she looked down because she knew</div>
<div class="i1">Her nose was big enough for two.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Sometimes her narrow kitchen walls</div>
<div class="i1">Stretched away into stately halls</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And for him with a pipe in his ugly mug&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Oh, if she had him by the lug!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A manly form at her side she saw</div>
<div class="i1">And there was no estival catarrh.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then she took up her burden of life anew</div>
<div class="i1">Sighing only “Ah-chee! Ah-choo!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Alas! for maiden; for Judge alas!</div>
<div class="i1">For household drudger, and gray haired ass.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Of all sad words of tongue or pen</div>
<div class="i1">The saddest are “Hay fever time again.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Ah! well for us that a region lies</div>
<div class="i1">Where the infusoria never rise;</div>

<div class="poemdivider">(<cite>A Ballad of New England life.</cite>)</div>
<div class="i1">Where the Moosatockmaguntic</div>
<div class="i1">Pours its waters in the Skuntic,</div>
<div class="i3">Met, along the forest-side,</div>
<div class="i3">Hiram Hover, Huldah Hyde.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">She, a maiden fair and dapper,</div>
<div class="i1">He, a red-haired, stalwart trapper,</div>
<div class="i3">Hunting beaver, mink, and skunk,</div>
<div class="i3">In the woodlands of Squeedunk.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">She, Pentucket’s pensive daughter,</div>
<div class="i1">Walked beside the Skuntic water,</div>
<div class="i3">Gathering, in her apron wet,</div>
<div class="i3">Snake-root, mint, and bouncing-bet.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Why,” he murmured, loth to leave her,</div>
<div class="i1">“Gather yarbs for chills and fever,</div>
<div class="i3">When a lovyer, bold and true,</div>
<div class="i3">Only waits to gather you?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Go,” she answered, “I’m not hasty;</div>
<div class="i1">I prefer a man more tasty:</div>
<div class="i3">Leastways, one to please me well</div>
<div class="i3">Should not have a beasty smell.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Haughty Huldah!” Hiram answered;</div>
<div class="i1">“Mind and heart alike are cancered:</div>
<div class="i3">Jest look here! these peltries give</div>
<div class="i3">Cash, wherefrom a pair may live.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“I, you think, am but a vagrant,</div>
<div class="i1">Trapping beasts by no means fragrant:</div>
<div class="i3">Yet&mdash;I’m sure it’s worth a thank&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">I’ve a handsome sum in bank.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Turned and vanished Hiram Hover;</div>
<div class="i1">And, before the year was over,</div>
<div class="i3">Huldah, with the yarbs she sold,</div>
<div class="i3">Bought a cape, against the cold.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Black and thick the furry cape was;</div>
<div class="i1">Of a stylish cut the shape was;</div>
<div class="i3">And the girls, in all the town,</div>
<div class="i3">Envied Huldah up and down.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then, at last, one winter morning,</div>
<div class="i1">Hiram came, without a warning:</div>
<div class="i3">“Either,” said he, “you are blind,</div>
<div class="i3">Huldah, or you’ve changed your mind.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Me you snub for trapping varmints,</div>
<div class="i1">Yet you take the skins for garments:</div>
<div class="i3">Since you wear the skunk and mink,</div>
<div class="i3">There’s no harm in me, I think.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Well,” said she, “we will not quarrel,</div>
<div class="i1">“Hiram: I accept the moral.</div>
<div class="i3">Now the fashion’s so, I guess</div>
<div class="i3">I can’t hardly do no less.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Thus the trouble all was over</div>
<div class="i1">Of the love of Hiram Hover;</div>
<div class="i3">Thus he made sweet Huldah Hyde</div>
<div class="i3">Huldah Hover as his bride.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Love employs, with equal favour,</div>
<div class="i1">Things of good and evil savour;</div>
<div class="i3">That, which first appeared to part,</div>
<div class="i3">Warmed, at last, the maiden’s heart.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Under one impartial banner,</div>
<div class="i1">Life, the hunter, Love, the tanner,</div>
<div class="i3">Draw, from every beast they snare,</div>
<div class="i3">Comfort for a wedded pair!</div>

<p>This is an imitation of the style of some of Whittier’s
delightful ballads, only substituting a comical for an earnest
motive. Change that motive, and a few expressions, and it
would become a serious poem.</p>

<div class="i1">The fire burst out as she clared the bar,</div>
<div class="i2">And burnt a hole in the night,</div>
<div class="i1">And quick as a flash she turned, and made</div>
<div class="i2">To that willer-bank on the right.</div>
<div class="i1">There was runnin’ and cursin,’ but Jim yelled out</div>

<h3 class="h3head">James Russell Lowell.</h3>

<p>In the great American Civil War Mr. J. S.
Lowell was a warm partisan of the Northern
cause, and his most popular poems, <cite>The Biglow
Papers</cite>, were written in favour of the emancipation
of the slaves, and the suppression of the
Southern, or Confederate States. <cite>The Biglow
Papers</cite> have been principally parodied, in this
country, by the Liberal newspapers, and of
these only a few examples are sufficiently good
to bear quoting.</p>

<div class="i1">Behind her, blown by all the postal winds,</div>
<div class="i1">Letters and manuscripts from unknown hands.</div>
<div class="i1">Thus came not Ahab’s: his he brought himself,</div>
<div class="i1">One morn, so clear with impecunious gold.</div>
<div class="i1">I said: “Chaucer yet lives, and Calderon!”</div>
<div class="i1">And, letting down the gangways of the mind</div>
<div class="i1">For shipment from the piers of common life,</div>
<div class="i1">O’er Learning’s ballast meant some lighter freight</div>
<div class="i1">To stow, for export to Macarian Isles</div>

<div class="i1">Homespun, at least,&mdash;thereat I swiftly felt</div>
<div class="i1">Somewhat of comfort,&mdash;tall, knock-kneed, and gaunt:</div>

<div class="i1">Oppressive: but he bore it like a man;</div>

<div class="i1">I <em>be</em> one; so the people say to hum.”</div>
<div class="i1">Then from his cavernous armpit drew and gave</div>
<div class="i1">The singing leaves, not such as erst I knew.</div>
<div class="i1">But strange, disjointed, where the unmeasured feet</div>
<div class="i1">Staggered allwhither in pursuit of rhyme,</div>
<div class="i1">And could not find it: assonance instead,</div>
<div class="i1">Cases and verbs misplaced&mdash;remediable those&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Broad-shouldered coarseness, fondly meant for wit.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I turned the leaves; his small, gray, hungry eye</div>

<div class="i1">We use on such occasions,&mdash;better wait,</div>
<div class="i1">Verse must have time; its seed, like timothy-grass,</div>
<div class="i1">Sown in the fall to sprout the following spring,</div>
<div class="i1">Is often winter-killed: none can decide;</div>
<div class="i1">A single rain-drop prints the eocene,</div>

<div class="i1">Months passed: the catbird on the elm-tree sang</div>

<div class="i1">As earth were made October twenty-seventh</div>
<div class="i1">(Some ancient Bible gives the date), he shot</div>
<div class="i1">Across my path as sped from Ensign’s bow,</div>
<div class="i1">More grewsome, haggard-seeming than before.</div>
<div class="i1">Ere from his sinister armpit his right hand</div>
<div class="i1">Could pluck the sheets, I thundered forth, “Aroint!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Not using the Anglo-Saxon shibboleth,</div>
<div class="i1">But exorcismal terms, unusual, fierce,</div>
<div class="i1">Such as would make a saint disintimate.</div>
<div class="i1">The witless terror in his face nigh stayed</div>
<div class="i1">My speech, but I was firm and passed him by.</div>
<div class="i1">Ah, not three weeks were sped ere he again</div>
<div class="i1">Waylaid me in the meadows, with these words:</div>
<div class="i1">“I saw thet suthin’ riled you, the last time;</div>
<div class="i1">Be you in sperrits now?”&mdash;and drew again&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">But why go on? I met him yesterday,</div>
<div class="i1">The nineteenth time,&mdash;pale, sad, but patient still.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">When Hakon steered the dragons, there was place,</div>
<div class="i1">Though but a thrall’s, beside the eagle-helms,</div>
<div class="i1">For him who rhymed instead of rougher work,</div>
<div class="i1">For speech is thwarted deed: the Berserk fire</div>
<div class="i1">But smoulders now in strange attempts at verse,</div>
<div class="i1">While hammering sword-blows mend the halting rhyme,</div>
<div class="i1">Give mood and tense unto the well-thewed arm,</div>

<h3 class="h3head">Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes.</h3>

<p>An English edition of <cite>The Autocrat of the
Breakfast Table</cite> was published some years ago
by Messrs. Chatto and Windus, with an Introduction
by Mr. George Augustus Sala. Holmes
was not then well known, or understood, in this
country, yet surely such a veteran <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">litérateur</i> as
Sala might have found some more appropriate
opening sentence for his Introduction than
this:&mdash;“Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes is essentially
what is termed a ‘funny fellow.’”</p>

<p>Written of Artemus Ward, Bret Harte, or
Mark Twain, the assertion might have been
true, though not new, as applied to Holmes it
is neither the one, nor the other.</p>

<p>Pathos there is in plenty, with dry humour
and playful wit, which occasionally tempt a
smile, as in the following poem, though most
assuredly it cannot be termed “funny” in the
ordinary acceptation of the word.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Have you heard of the wonderful one-hoss shay,</div>
<div class="i1">That was built in such a logical way,</div>
<div class="i1">It ran a hundred years to a day,</div>
<div class="i1">And then, of a sudden, it&mdash;ah, but stay,</div>
<div class="i1">I’ll tell you what happened without delay,</div>
<div class="i1">Scaring the parson into fits,</div>
<div class="i1">Frightening people out of their wits,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Have you ever heard of that, I say?</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Seventeen hundred and fifty-five,</div>
<div class="i1"><cite>Georgius Secundus</cite> was then alive,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Snuffy old drone from the German hive.</div>
<div class="i1">That was the year when Lisbon-town</div>

<div class="i1">And Braddock’s army was done so brown,</div>
<div class="i1">Left without a scalp to its crown.</div>
<div class="i1">It was on the terrible earthquake day</div>
<div class="i1">That the Deacon finished the one-hoss shay.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now in building of chaises, I tell you what,</div>

<div class="i1">And that’s the reason, beyond a doubt,</div>
<div class="i1">A chaise <em>breaks down</em>, but doesn’t <em>wear out</em>.</div>

<div class="i1">But the Deacon swore (as Deacons do,</div>

<div class="i1">Wakes on the morn of its hundredth year</div>
<div class="i1">Without both feeling and looking queer.</div>
<div class="i1">In fact, there’s nothing that keeps it youth,</div>
<div class="i1">So far as I know, but a tree and truth.</div>

<div class="i1">There couldn’t be,&mdash;for the Deacon’s art</div>

<p>There is a burlesque of O. W. Holmes in Bayard Taylor’s
<cite>Diversions of the Echo Club</cite>, entitled “The Psycho-Physical
Muse,” but it is not an interesting specimen of Taylor’s
power of imitation. A parody, “The Wheelless,” relating
to bicycling, appears in <cite>Lyra Bicyclica</cite>, by J. G. Dalton
(published in Boston, U.S., in 1880), but it is not of general

<h3 class="h3head">WALT WHITMAN.</h3>

<p>It is the part, one might almost say, <em>the duty</em>,
of the parodist to exaggerate the defects of his
original, and in the case of Whitman assuredly
no mercy, and little justice have been shown.
This is to be regretted, because Whitman has
not so many readers in this country, as his
parodists can command, and it is distinctly an
advantage to have read the original poem before
getting imbued with the bathos, and intentional
nonsense of a parody. It is comparatively
easy to reproduce and caricature Whitman’s
<em>manner</em>. Consequently his mannerisms are far
more familiar to most English readers than the
vigour of his poetry, especially as owing to the
mock-modesty of editors and publishers, many
of his finest thoughts on the mysteries of nature,
and the philosophy of life, have been omitted in
English editions of his works.</p>

<p>Whitman is emphatically a poet for <em>men</em>, not
for “Select Academies for the Daughters of
Gentlemen only;” and whilst much that he has
written is glorious poetry to those who will, and
can imbibe its spirit freely, to those who cannot
thus absorb it the Parodies will appear nearly
as poetical as the original. His principal
volume, “Leaves of Grass,” as published by
James R. Osgood &amp; Company, of Boston, U.S.,
is a marvellous book, but one from which it is
extremely difficult to make a satisfactory selection
of quotations which, whilst doing justice to
Whitman, shall, at the same time, illustrate
the parodies.</p>

<p>Not to be chosen from his solemn <cite>Salut au
Monde</cite>, nor the pathetic <cite>Drum-taps</cite>, nor even
from the much abused <cite>Children of Adam</cite>, these
must be read entire, or not at all.</p>

<p>Walt Whitman’s egotism is a favourite topic
with the parodists, here is a small extract from
his</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">SONG OF MYSELF.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">I celebrate myself, and sing myself,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">My tongue, every atom of my blood, formed from this soil, this air,</div>
<div class="i1">Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same,</div>
<div class="i1">I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,</div>
<div class="i1">Hoping to cease not till death.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Creeds and schools in abeyance.</div>
<div class="i1">Retiring back awhile sufficed at what they are, but never Forgotten,</div>
<div class="i1">I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,</div>
<div class="i1">Nature without check with original energy.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contained,</div>
<div class="i1">I stand and look at them long and long.</div>
<div class="i1">They do not sweat and whine about their condition,</div>
<div class="i1">They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,</div>
<div class="i1">They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,</div>
<div class="i1">Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things,</div>
<div class="i1">Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,</div>
<div class="i1">Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.</div>
<div class="i1">So they show their relations to me and I accept them,</div>
<div class="i1">They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their possession.</div>
<div class="i1">A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,</div>
<div class="i1">Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears,</div>
<div class="i1">Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,</div>
<div class="i1">Eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.</div>
<div class="i1">His nostrils dilate as my heels embracing</div>
<div class="i1">His well-built limbs, tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.</div>
<div class="i1">I but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,</div>
<div class="i1">Why do I need your paces when I myself can out-gallop them?</div>
<div class="i1">Even as I stand or sit passing faster than you.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">I too, am not a bit tamed, I too, am untranslatable,</div>
<div class="i1">I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</div>
<div class="i1">The last scud of day holds back for me,</div>
<div class="i1">It flings my likeness after the rest, and true as any on the shadow’d wilds,</div>
<div class="i1">It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.</div>
<div class="i1">I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,</div>

<p>This is not poetry of the tinkling rhyme, and those
who require to hear the changes rung on the old, old peal of
bells&mdash;love, dove, heart, part,&mdash;must seek elsewhere than
in the writings of Walt Whitman. Lord Tennyson
considers him a true poet, so did Swinburne till he took
to renouncing all the opinions of his youth, and turned
from the praise of revolution, and the anticipation of the
happy time when “Prince that clogs and priest that clings,
Be cast as weeds upon the dunghill of dead things,”
to become the reciter of Jubilee odes. Here are a
few extracts from his verses “<cite>To Walt Whitman in
America</cite>:”&mdash;</p>

<div class="i1">Ours, in the tempest at error,</div>
<div class="i1">With no light but the twilight of terror;</div>

<p>As long ago as 1855, Emerson, a clear sighted critic,
wrote: “I am not blind to the worth of the wonderful
gift of ‘Leaves of grass.’ I find it the most extraordinary
piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.

I am very happy in reading it, as great power makes us
happy. I give you joy of your free and brave thought.
I have great joy in it; I find incomparable things, said
incomparably well, as they should be.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A Pension for Walt Whitman.</span></p>

<p>A prosaic bill, drawn up in the tiresome form of such
measures, was introduced into the United States Congress
in 1887, to give Walt Whitman a pension. He was a
hospital nurse in the war, and earned such a recognition.</p>

<p>When the bill reaches the Senate, however, says the
<cite>Boston Record</cite>, Senator Blair or some other poet, ought to
substitute a bill couched in Whitmanese, somewhat as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="hanging">“Be it enacted, solidified, plastered, pasted, nailed, tied,
 hem-stitched, and generally made invulnerable,</p>
<p class="hanging">That Walt Whitman, bard, slinger of pronouns, server of mixed 
drinks in the form of verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs,</p>
<p class="hanging">Be granted, allowed, made to swallow, consume, and digest the
 sum of dollars, ducats, promises to pay hereinafter mentioned, said, sung, and cast up.”</p>

<div class="i1">His name was Joseph, and he was raised at Sharon, Windsor County, Vermont, U.S.</div>
<span class="pageno">261</span>
<div class="i1">His parents were tillers of the soil&mdash;poor, but dishonest,</div>
<div class="i1">When they wanted money, they took it; horses, they boned them; sheep, they annexed them;</div>
<div class="i1">But saints may spring from sinners, as a butterfly springs from a maggot.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Angels! heavenly visions!!</div>
<div class="i1">In white robes, with crowns, harps, and everything according,</div>
<div class="i1">Bless’d the youthful Smith with their presence beatific.</div>
<div class="i1">He went into solitude, loafing in caves, backwoods, and lonely canyons.</div>
<div class="i1">Those angels meant business; thrice in one night they sought him.</div>
<div class="i1">They told him all his sins were liquidated,</div>
<div class="i1">Told him the history of the world (<em>not</em> according to Moses),</div>
<div class="i1">Told him the Red Injuns was one of the lost tribes of Israel;</div>
<div class="i1">Told him where to find the sacred book of the Prophet Mormon,</div>
<div class="i1">Told him to bring it out, and make a good “spec” of the business.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Leap, O my soul, every 22nd of September,</div>
<div class="i1">For on that date Smith found the sacred volume!</div>
<div class="i1">Eighteen-twenty-seven&mdash;a year to be remembered!!!</div>
<div class="i1">Sheets of tin, with characters antique engraven&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Such was the wondrous Book of Mormon.</div>
<div class="i1">From that prophet Smith profited, and became a prophet also.</div>
<div class="i1">Mahomet, Brahma, Buddha, Confucius&mdash;Smith surpassed them all.</div>
<div class="i1">Getting behind a screen, he dictated to Oliver Cowdrey</div>
<div class="i1">(Smith was not a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">literatus</i>, and couldn’t have jerk’d it grammatically).</div>
<div class="i1">In eighteen-thirty, hurrah! the glorious Book was publish’d.</div>
<div class="i1">But carping critics of orthodoxy murmured “fraud!” and “humbug!”</div>
<div class="i1">“Where’s your authority? Show us the original!”</div>
<div class="i1">Smith disdained to do so; he and his friends had seen it,</div>
<div class="i1">But nobody else has seen it, nor will they see it forever.</div>
<div class="i1">Yet did Smith triumph, and gathered in converts like hay in the sunshine.</div>
<div class="i1">Virtue will ever prevail, as long as the world circumvolvulates on its axis.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Huzza for the New Jerusalem!</div>
<div class="i1">At Kirtland, Ohio, Smith with his Saints located,</div>
<div class="i1">Till, in March, ’32, there came a band of Nonconformists,</div>
<div class="i1">Seized Joseph the Saint, and Rigdon his mate, and gave them tar and feathers!</div>
<div class="i1">O my soul, boil, boil like a potato with indignation!</div>
<div class="i1">From county to county, and state to state, for years the Mormons were driven,</div>
<div class="i1">Sometimes camping out ’neath the snow-cold stars of winter.</div>
<div class="i1">At last they found a resting place&mdash;Clay county, in Missouri.</div>
<div class="i1">Thither came Brigham Young&mdash;at that time Brigham Younger.</div>
<div class="i1">Smith sent him out to bring to grace those sceptical down-easters,</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst Orson Pratt and Heber C. Kimball were missionaries in Europe.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">In this world banks will break, and promoters be call’d swindlers:</div>
<div class="i1">This was the luck of Smith and his saintly <span class="lock">companions&mdash;</span></div>
<div class="i1">Lo! the bank of Kirtland busted, the Mormons were clapp’d in prison,</div>
<div class="i1">Not long afterwards they received this heavenly revelation&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“Missouri’s too hot to hold you”&mdash;they “vamoused the ranche,” according.</div>
<div class="i1">O, Nauvoo, city of Beauty!</div>
<div class="i1">Land of delight, fertility, promise, and blossoming realizations!</div>
<div class="i1">When I beheld thee my soul was enthrall’d, and danced a spirited <em>can-can</em>.
Thither came 15,000 saints, and squatted in glory,</div>
<div class="i1">And the desert blossom’d as the rose, beneath the smile of Smith.</div>
<div class="i1">He preach’d the gospel, and got up a government-house and militia,</div>
<div class="i1">Was mayor of the town, high priest, and commander-in-chief of the army;</div>
<div class="i1">O, <em>gloria</em>! triumph! bravo! hosannah! huzza! halleluiah!</div>
<div class="i1">(These are the words of a soul jumping out of its skin with felicity.)</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Once more “revelation” came, and spake unto Smith the prophet.</div>
<div class="i1">“The relation between man and woman is not only social but spiritual.</div>
<div class="i1">The social is bounded by two, the spiritual knows of no limit;</div>
<div class="i1">Wherefore, O Smith, you may take what number of wives you think proper,</div>
<div class="i1">Sanctifying them by sacred mysterious ‘sealings.’”</div>
<div class="i1">(Reader, seekest thou further to know, then go and consult Hepworth Dixon.)</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But the cold hard world disapproved of spiritual marriage;</div>
<div class="i1">War rose up against Smith, and again, with his mates, he was cast into prison,</div>
<div class="i1">“Revelation” helped them no more; no, nor did angels assist them;</div>
<div class="i1">But a gang of rowdies (<span class="sc lowercase">A.D.</span> 1844) broke into the prison,</div>
<div class="i1">Haul’d out Joseph Smith and his brother Hyram,</div>
<div class="i1">And with their too-true revolvers they sent them both to glory!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Sinners make martyrs, and martyrs make saints (this is logic.)</div>
<div class="i1">Smith was a martyr, and mourned by the Mormons according,</div>
<div class="i1">Especially Brigham Young, who came in for his fortune and fixtures.</div>
<div class="i1">In 1850 they established the Salt Lake City,</div>
<div class="i1">And two years later another great “revelation” set up spiritual
 wifehood, the glorious cause that Smith died for.</div>
<div class="i1">Thus, like a beautiful tree, grew up the doctrine of spiritual marriage,</div>
<div class="i1">Monogamy, bigamy, trigamy, quadrigamy, quinquigamy, and lastly polygamy&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Till, if you ask me, “How many wives has Brigham?”</div>
<div class="i1">I shall answer, “Go, count the waves of the boundless Atlantic!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">They made Smith a saint&mdash;a boss saint&mdash;and was he not worthy?</div>

<div class="i1">Bully for Joseph! my eyes fill with tears; don’t yours?</div>
<div class="i1">I admire Joe Smith&mdash;I <em>du</em>&mdash;I’ll wrap up his memory in lavender,</div>

<div class="i1">Go thou and do likewise.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Mourn for Smith; mourn, mourn, ye peoples!</div>

<p class="p2 center larger">“SHERIDAN’S RIDE.”</p>

<p>Towards the close of the great Civil War, the United
States General Sheridan made a movement against the
Southern troops under the command of General Early,
in the Shenandoah Valley. Sheridan wasted the valley,
and broke Early all to pieces in a great battle, for which
General Grant ordered a salute of a hundred guns.
But soon Early, reinforced by Longstreet, was ready to

move against the intruder in overwhelming force. The
movement was a surprise. Sheridan had been absent at
Washington, and he was returning to his post, when he met
the whole army running towards him in panic and rout.
Then began the famous “ride” from Winchester to the
front. Deploying his cavalry across the valley to stop the
first stragglers, he dashed forward with a handful of men
right through his own beaten force towards the victorious foe.
As he met each flying regiment he ordered the men to turn
about, reminding them that, while they were making excellent
progress, they were “going the wrong way.” His desperate
energy, and his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mot</i> together, saved the battle, and turned
the rout into a victory.</p>

<p>General Philip Sheridan was born in Ireland, in March,
1831, and died at Nonquit, Massachusetts, on Sunday,
August 5, 1888.</p>

<div class="i1">As if he knew the terrible need,</div>
<div class="i1">He stretched away with the utmost speed;</div>

<div class="i1">And the steed, like a bark fed with furnace ire,</div>
<div class="i1">Swept on with his wild eyes full of fire:</div>
<div class="i1">But, lo! he is nearing his heart’s desire&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">He is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray,</div>
<div class="i5">With Sheridan only <em>five</em> miles away!</div>

<div class="i1">And striking his spurs with a terrible oath,</div>

<div class="i2">The lilied heifers gleamed beneath the shed;</div>
<div class="i1">And spirits from the high ancestral wood</div>
<div class="i2">Cast their articulate benisons on my head.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The twilight oriole sang her valentine</div>
<div class="i2">From pendulous nests above the stable-sill,</div>
<div class="i1">And, like a beggar, asking alms and wine,</div>
<div class="i2">Came the importunate murmur of the mill.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Love threw his flying shuttle through my woof,</div>
<div class="i2">And made the web a pattern I abhorred;</div>
<div class="i1">Wherefore alone I sang, and far aloof,</div>
<div class="i2">My melting melodies, mightier than the sword.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The white-sleeved mowers, coming slowly home,</div>
<div class="i2">With scythes like rainbows on their shoulders hung,</div>
<div class="i1">Sniffed not, in passing me, the scent of Rome,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor heard the music trickling from my tongue.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The milkmaid following, delayed her step,</div>
<div class="i2">Still singing as she left the stable-yard:</div>
<div class="i1">’Twas “Sheridan’s Ride,” she sang; I turned and wept,</div>
<div class="i2">For woman’s homage soothes the suffering bard.</div>

<p>In publishing this a few years ago, the <cite>New York Tribune</cite>
said, “The above exquisite poem was written in 1857,
when the young lady, the author, was under 20. It was
addressed to a certain young gentleman, the hero of the

the poem that he published quite an edition on white satin

<p class="p2 center larger">“THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS.”</p>

<p><cite>Harper’s Cyclopædia of Poetry</cite> says Clement C.
Moore (1779-1863) was the son of a bishop, and
a native of New York City. In 1844 he published
a volume of poems dedicated to his
children. One of them, founded on an old
Dutch tradition, is generally known as “The

Night before Christmas,” although the author
christened it “A Visit from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas.”</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">’Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house,</div>
<div class="i1">Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;</div>
<div class="i1">The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,</div>
<div class="i1">In hopes that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas soon would be there.</div>
<div class="i1">The children were nestled all snug in their beds,</div>
<div class="i1">While visions of sugar plums danced through their heads;</div>
<div class="i1">And mamma in her kerchief and I in my cap,</div>
<div class="i1">Had just settled our brains for a long winter’s nap,</div>
<div class="i1">When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,</div>
<div class="i1">I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.</div>
<div class="i1">Away to the window I flew like a flash,</div>
<div class="i1">Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.</div>
<div class="i1">The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow</div>
<div class="i1">Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below;</div>
<div class="i1">When, what to my wondering eyes did appear</div>
<div class="i1">But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,</div>
<div class="i1">With a little old driver so lively and quick,</div>
<div class="i1">I knew in a moment it must be <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nic.</div>
<div class="i1">More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,</div>
<div class="i1">And he whistled and shouted and called them by name:</div>
<div class="i1">“Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer! and Vixen!</div>
<div class="i1">On Comet! on Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen!</div>
<div class="i1">To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!</div>
<div class="i1">Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!”</div>
<div class="i1">As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,</div>
<div class="i1">When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,</div>
<div class="i1">So up to the housetop the coursers they flew,</div>
<div class="i1">With the sleigh full of toys, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas too,</div>
<div class="i1">And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof,</div>
<div class="i1">The prancing and pawing of each little hoof,</div>
<div class="i1">As I drew in my head and was turning around,</div>
<div class="i1">Down the chimney <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas came with a bound.</div>
<div class="i1">He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,</div>
<div class="i1">And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;</div>
<div class="i1">A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,</div>
<div class="i1">And he looked like a pedlar just opening his pack.</div>
<div class="i1">His eyes how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!</div>
<div class="i1">His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry,</div>
<div class="i1">His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,</div>
<div class="i1">And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;</div>
<div class="i1">The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,</div>
<div class="i1">And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.</div>
<div class="i1">He had a broad face and a little round belly,</div>
<div class="i1">That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly,</div>
<div class="i1">He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,</div>
<div class="i1">And I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself;</div>
<div class="i1">A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,</div>
<div class="i1">Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;</div>
<div class="i1">He spoke not a word but went straight to his work,</div>
<div class="i1">And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,</div>
<div class="i1">And laying his finger aside of his nose,</div>
<div class="i1">And giving a nod up the chimney he rose.</div>
<div class="i1">He sprang to his sleigh, to the team gave a whistle,</div>
<div class="i1">And away they all flew like the down of a thistle,</div>
<div class="i1">But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,</div>
<div class="i1">“Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.”</div>

<div class="i1">“Don’t you think you had better, love, run for the doctor!”</div>
<div class="i1">I ran, and was scarcely back under my roof,</div>

<div class="i1">I might say that I hardly had turned myself round,</div>
<div class="i1">When the doctor came into the room with a bound;</div>
<div class="i1">He was covered with mud from his head to his foot,</div>
<div class="i1">And the suit he had on was his very worst suit,</div>
<div class="i1">He had hardly had time to put this on his back,</div>
<div class="i1">And he looked like a Falstaff half fuddled with sack.</div>
<div class="i1">His eyes how they twinkled! Had the doctor got merry?</div>
<div class="i1">His cheeks looked like Port, and his breath smelt of Sherry.</div>
<div class="i1">He had’nt been shaved for a fortnight or so,</div>
<div class="i1">And the beard on his chin wasn’t white as the snow.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But inspecting their tongues in despite of their teeth,</div>
<div class="i1">And drawing his watch from his waistcoat beneath,</div>

<div class="i1">Must get rid”&mdash;here he laughed&mdash;“of the rest of that jelly.”</div>
<div class="i1">I gazed on each chubby plump sick little elf,</div>
<div class="i1">And groaned when he said so&mdash;in spite of myself,</div>
<div class="i1">But a wink of his eye when he physicked our Fred,</div>
<div class="i1">Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.</div>
<div class="i1">He didn’t prescribe, but went straightway to work,</div>
<div class="i1">He dosed all the rest; gave his trousers a jerk,</div>
<div class="i1">And adding directions while blowing his nose,</div>

<p class="p2 center larger">“THE PICKET GUARD.”</p>

<p>An American gentleman writes, that “one
of the finest of the war productions was Thad
Oliver’s, ‘The Picket Guard.’ I send the enclosed
copy of it, as it may not be at hand for
you, and the parody takes hold of all of us who
have ever had experience in broken banks,
and know how convenient Canada is.”</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">“All quiet along the Potomac,” they say,</div>
<div class="i2">“Except now and then a stray picket</div>
<div class="i1">Is shot, as he walks on his beat to and fro,</div>
<div class="i2">By a rifleman hid in the thicket.</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis nothing: a private or two now and then,</div>
<div class="i2">Will not count in the news of the battle;</div>
<div class="i1">Not an officer lost&mdash;only one of the men,</div>
<div class="i2">Moaning out all alone the death rattle.”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">All quiet along the Potomac to-night,</div>
<div class="i2">Where the soldiers lie peacefully dreaming;</div>

<div class="i1">A tremulous sigh, as the gentle light wind</div>
<div class="i2">Through the forest leaves softly is creeping;</div>
<div class="i1">While stars up above with their glittering eyes</div>
<div class="i2">Keep guard,&mdash;for the army is sleeping.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">There’s only the sound of the lone sentry’s tread,</div>
<div class="i2">As he tramps from the rock to the fountain,</div>
<div class="i1">And thinks of the two in the low trundle bed</div>
<div class="i2">Far away in the cot on the mountain.</div>
<div class="i1">His musket falls slack; his face, dark and grim,</div>
<div class="i2">Grows gentle with memories tender,</div>
<div class="i1">As he mutters a prayer for the children asleep,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">For their mother,&mdash;may Heaven defend her.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The moon seems to shine just as brightly as then,</div>
<div class="i2">That night when the love yet unspoken,</div>
<div class="i1">Leaped up to his lips,&mdash;when low murmured vows,</div>
<div class="i2">Were pledged to be ever unbroken.</div>
<div class="i1">Then drawing his sleeve roughly over his eyes,</div>
<div class="i2">He dashes off tears that are welling,</div>
<div class="i1">And gathers his gun closer up to its place,</div>
<div class="i2">As if to keep down the heart swelling.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He passes the fountain, the blasted pine tree&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">The footstep is lagging and weary;</div>
<div class="i1">Yet onward he goes, through the broad belt of light,</div>
<div class="i2">Toward the shades of the forest so dreary.</div>
<div class="i1">Hark! was it the night wind that rustled the leaves?</div>
<div class="i2">Was it moonlight so wondrously flashing?</div>
<div class="i1">It looked like a rifle: “Ha! Mary good-bye!”</div>
<div class="i2">And the life blood is ebbing and plashing.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">All quiet along the Potomac to-night,</div>
<div class="i2">No sound save the rush of the river;</div>
<div class="i1">While soft falls the dew on the face of the dead,</div>
<div class="i2">The picket’s off duty for ever.</div>

<p class="p2 center larger">BEAUTIFUL SNOW.</p>

<p>In the early part of the American civil war, one dark
morning in the dead of winter, there died at the Commercial
Hospital, Cincinnati, a young woman over whose head only
two-and-twenty summers had passed. Once the pride of
respectable parentage, her first wrong step was the small
beginning of the “same old story over again,” which has
been the only life-history of thousands. Highly educated
and accomplished in manners, she might have shone in the
best of Society. But the evil hour that proved her ruin was
but the door from childhood; and having spent a young life
in disgrace and shame, the poor friendless one died the
melancholy death of a broken-hearted outcast.</p>

<p>Among her personal effects was found in manuscript, the
“Beautiful Snow,” which was seen by Enos B. Reed, a
gentleman of culture and literary tastes, who was at that
time editor of the <cite>National Union</cite>. In the columns of that
paper, on the morning following the girl’s death, the poem
appeared in print for the first time. When the paper containing
the poem came out on Sunday morning, the body of
the victim had not yet received burial. The attention of
Thomas Buchanan Read, one of the first American poets,
was soon directed to the newly-published lines, who was so
taken with their stirring pathos that he followed the corpse
to its final resting-place.</p>

<p>The above account of the origin of the poem is that given
by Mr. James Hogg, as far back as 1874, and repeated by
him in the columns of “Notes and Queries” on July 3, 1875,
but it is open to considerable doubt.</p>

<p>Some American writers ascribe it to Mr. James M. Watson,
whilst others assert that it was written as far back as
December, 1852, by Major W. A. Sigourney, and that his
erring young wife was the miserable outcast described in the
poem. It is also stated that on the night of April 22, 1871,
Major Sigourney was found dead in the outskirts of New
York, under circumstances leading to the belief that he had
shot himself.</p>

<p>It is possible that Mr. Watson amplified and improved
the poem from the original draft of Major Sigourney, which
as usually printed, is shorter and far less pathetic.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">That Beautiful Kiss.</span></p>

<p>When Madame Patti was in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, U.S., in 1884, the
then Governor, Mr. T. T. Crittenden, called upon her, and
during some playful badinage, he kissed her. The newspapers
got hold of the story and humourously enlarged upon
it, one of them published the following parody, wickedly
ascribing it to the Governor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Oh, that kiss! that beautiful kiss!</div>
<div class="i1">Filling and thrilling my lips with its bliss;</div>

<div class="i1">The spot whereon ringlets of raven once growed,</div>
<div class="i1">Ere I sainted that Bourbon, the good Jesse James,</div>
<div class="i1">And saved brother Frank from the high scaffolds claims.</div>
<div class="i1">Jobbery,</div>

<div class="i1">Sound as when cow pulls her hoof from the mud.</div>
<div class="i1">Nicolini stood by, but I cared not a whit</div>
<div class="i1">For him, or the fury of bold Mrs. Crit,</div>
<div class="i1">I let all ambitions bright hopes float in wrack,</div>

<p>It could scarcely have been the same newspaper writer
who wrote the following unfavourable criticism upon Madame
Patti’s singing: “Her technique is bad, besides being too
small. When a bran-new technique can now be had for
three dollars, and a good second-hand one, holding over two
quarts, for $1.75, there is no excuse for this. Of course we
all know&mdash;all we critics&mdash;that there are no tears in Mrs. A.
Patti’s voice, which is the reason for her having to wet
her whistle so early and often. There is a marked deficiency
in breadth, and depth, and thickness in the upper register,
which does not admit the air freely in consequence, and a
far-off nearness, a sort of inanimate after-taste, so to speak,
in the diminuendo of her flats, particularly her French flat.
Her singular mannerism of holding her chin lopsided during
her G ups is in bad form, and the first thing she knows, one
of her sharps will come out edgeways and cut her throat.
Then she opens her mouth too much and too often when she
sings, which makes her chest-notes mouthy, and her mouth-notes
chesty. It would be much better, to say nothing of
more artistic, if she were to open only one side of her mouth
at a time. This would save wear and tear of her teeth, and
at the same time give the other corner time to rest and brace
up. She exerts herself too much in her trills, and it would
save her both breath and expense if she had them hereafter
done behind the scenes, by a boy with a dog-whistle or
something.”</p>

<p>Although, as has been seen, American writers have
abundance of humour, it does not make them proud, and
they will appropriate the comic writings of our authors,
without acknowledgment, in the most condescending manner.
A volume of amusing verse entitled “Songs of Singularity”
was brought out by Mr. Walter Parke in 1874, it contained
a ballad on the mother-in-law, a theme of never-failing
fruitfulness to the satirist. That same ballad afterwards
appeared in the <cite>San Francisco News Letter</cite>, duly appropriated
and altered to suit the local market, without one word of
acknowledgment to the original author.</p>

<p>From <cite>Poems and Parodies</cite> by Phœbe Carey, Boston, U.S.
1854.</p>

<p>The same interesting little volume contains a number of
clever parodies, of which those on the best known poets have
already been printed in this collection. The remainder refer
principally to American authors whose works are not very
familiar to British readers. The book is out of print and
very scarce, and although there is a copy of it in the
Library, British Museum (11687. d), it is difficult to find, as
it is improperly catalogued under <cite>Cary</cite>, instead of <cite>Carey</cite>.</p>

<p>Another curious American book is entitled “<cite>Strange
Visitors</cite>, by the spirits of Irving, Willis, Thackeray,
Bronté, Richter, Byron, Humboldt, Hawthorne, Wesley,
Browning, and others, now dwelling in the Spirit World.”
Dictated through a Clairvoyant while in an abnormal or
Trance State. New York. G. W. Carleton, publisher, 1869.</p>

<p>Most of the papers in this volume are in prose, the following
only are in verse:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="">
<tr><td class="left pad7">To his Accusers</td>
    <td class="left pad7">after Lord Byron.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="left pad7">The Spirit Bride</td>
    <td class="left pad7">&emsp;“ &ensp; Adelaide A. Procter.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>All these imitations are serious, and even sombre, not to be
styled parodies, although of little merit, except, perhaps,
the imitation of Mrs. E. B. Browning.</p>

<p>Her spirit speaks thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">To her Husband.</span></div>
<div class="i3">Dead! dead! You call her dead!</div>

<div class="i1">Moving about you through the ambient air,</div>
<div class="i1">Smoothing the whitening ripples of your hair.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">Dead! dead! You call her dead!</div>
<div class="i1">Lift up your eyes! she is no longer dead!</div>
<div class="i1">In your lone path the unseen angels tread!</div>
<div class="i1">And when your weary night of earth shall close,</div>

<p class="p2 center larger">YANKEE DOODLE.</p>

<p>In the words of the Hon. Stephen Salisbury, “Yankee
Doodle is national property, but it is not a treasure of the
highest value. It has some antiquarian claims for which
its friends do not care. It cannot be disowned, and it
will not be disused. In its own words,</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<div class="i1">‘It suits for feasts, it suits for fun,</div>
<div class="i1">And just as well for fighting.’</div>

</div><!--end container-->

<p>It exists now as an instrumental and not as a vocal performance.
Its words are never heard, and, I think would
not be acceptable in either public or private American
entertainments.”</p>

<p>Sir George Grove, in his <cite>Dictionary of Music and
Musicians</cite>, (Macmillan, London), fully examines the
various theories as to the origin of this song. He inclines
to the opinion that the words were written by Dr. Schuckburgh
about 1755, with the title “The Yankee’s Return
from Camp.” The tune was printed in 1784 in an opera
by Arnold, entitled “Two to one,” where it is first
properly styled <cite>Yankee Doodle</cite>.</p>

<p>There has been much discussion as to the derivation of the
word Yankee, one theory being that it is the Indian way of
pronouncing <cite>English</cite>. The Indians cannot sound the letter
l, so they lengthen and soften the vowels. Hence the more
advanced among them only manage to pronounce <cite>English</cite>
as <em>Eengeesh</em>, while a more common sound would be <em>Angees</em>,
or <em>Ankees</em>. Possibly the Indians were more familiar with
the French form <cite>Anglais</cite>. A writer in <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>
stated the above fact, citing Hutchinson’s “History of Massachusetts”
as an authority; he added “Doodle is surely
only an imitation of the crowing of a cock.” The meaning,
if any, of <cite>Yankee Doodle</cite> is “New Englanders, be on the
alert,” or “show your spirit.” Another writer quotes a
derivation suggested by Thierry, that the word <em>Yankee</em> arose
from the collision and jeerings of the Dutch and English in
New York and New England, and that it is from the Dutch
<em>Jan</em>&mdash;pronounced <em>Yan</em>&mdash;John, with the common diminutive
<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a><span class="pageno">275</span>
<em>kee</em>, and doodlen, to quaver; which would make the whole
into “quavering or psalm-singing Jacky or Johnny.”</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the origin of the term, it is only
correctly applied to New Englanders, and not to the inhabitants
of the other states.</p>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The Origin of Yankee Doodle.</span></div>
<div class="poemdivider"><cite>After the manner of the old <br />Continental Ballad writers.</cite></div>
<div class="i1">Once on a time old Johnny Bull,</div>
<div class="i2">Flew in a raging fury,</div>
<div class="i1">And swore that Jonathan should have</div>
<div class="i2">No trials, Sir, by jury!</div>
<div class="i1">That no elections should be held,</div>
<div class="i2">Across the briny waters!</div>
<div class="i1">“And now,” says he, “I’ll tax the tea</div>
<div class="i2">Of all his sons and daughters.”</div>
<div class="i1">Then down he sat in burly state,</div>
<div class="i2">And blustered like a grandee,</div>
<div class="i1">And in derision made a tune</div>
<div class="i2">Called “Yankee doodle dandy.”</div>
<div class="i1">“Yankee Doodle”&mdash;these are facts&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">“Yankee doodle dandy!</div>
<div class="i1">“My son of wax, your tea I’ll tax&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">“Yankee doodle dandy.”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">John sent the tea from o’er the sea</div>
<div class="i2">With heavy duties rated;</div>
<div class="i1">But whether Hyson or Bohea,</div>
<div class="i2">I never heard it stated.</div>
<div class="i1">Then Jonathan to pout began&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">He laid a strong embargo&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“I’ll drink no tea, by Jove!” so he</div>
<div class="i2">Threw overboard the cargo.</div>
<div class="i1">Then Johnny sent a regiment,</div>
<div class="i2">Big words, and looks to bandy,</div>
<div class="i1">Whose martial band, when near the land,</div>
<div class="i2">Play’d “Yankee doodle dandy.”</div>
<div class="i1">“Yankee doodle&mdash;keep it up!</div>
<div class="i2">“Yankee doodle dandy!</div>
<div class="i1">“I’ll poison with a tax your cup,</div>
<div class="i2">“Yankee doodle dandy.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A long war then they had, in which</div>
<div class="i2">John was at last defeated&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And “Yankee doodle” was the march</div>
<div class="i2">To which his troops retreated.</div>
<div class="i1">Cute Jonathan, to see them fly,</div>
<div class="i2">Could not restrain his laughter:</div>
<div class="i1">“That tune,” says he, “suits to a <em>T</em>,</div>
<div class="i2">I’ll sing it ever after,”</div>
<div class="i1">Old Johnny’s face, to his disgrace,</div>
<div class="i2">Was flushed with beer and brandy,</div>
<div class="i1">E’en while he swore to sing no more,</div>
<div class="i2">This “Yankee doodle dandy.”</div>
<div class="i1">“Yankee doodle&mdash;ho! ah! he!</div>
<div class="i2">“Yankee doodle dandy&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“We kept the tune, but not the tea,</div>
<div class="i2">“Yankee doodle dandy.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I’ve told you now the origin</div>
<div class="i2">Of this most lively ditty,</div>
<div class="i1">Which Johnny Bull dislikes as “dull</div>
<div class="i2">And stupid”&mdash;what a pity!</div>
<div class="i1">With “Hail Columbia!” it is sung,</div>
<div class="i2">In chorus full and hearty&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">On land and main, we breathe the strain,</div>
<div class="i2">John made for his tea-party.</div>
<div class="i1">No matter how we rhyme the words,</div>
<div class="i2">The music speaks them handy,</div>
<div class="i1">And where’s the fair can’t sing the air,</div>

<p>These verses are taken from a long parody which appeared
in <cite>Punch</cite> (London), August 17, 1861, shortly after the
defeat of the Northerners at Manassas Junction. The cartoon
represented John Bull sneering and jeering at the
retreating Yankee soldiers, and the tone of the whole poem
was most insulting, whilst it showed that <cite>Punch</cite> (following
in the wake of <cite>The Times</cite>) sympathised with the Confederate
States.</p>

<p>It actually classed the protective duties levied by the
Northern States for the encouragement of native industry, as
equally immoral with the institution of slavery, which had
given rise to so many horrors in the South:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">“These for negro slavery strike,</div>
<div class="i2">Those for forced protection.</div>
<div class="i1">Yankee Doodle is the pot,</div>
<div class="i2">Southerner the kettle;</div>
<div class="i1">Equal morally, if not</div>
<div class="i2">Men of equal mettle.</div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>Unfortunately <cite>The Times</cite> was then considered abroad to
represent the public opinion of Great Britain, and much ill
feeling arose in consequence of its misrepresentations. At
one time it seemed as if this country would become embroiled
in the war, and what was worse, on the side of the
slave owners.</p>

<p>During this excitement many songs and parodies were
written about us in the States which were decidedly uncomplimentary,
reminding Britons that in their previous wars
with America they had suffered almost invariable defeat.</p>

<p>Several of these parodies are given in <cite>The Poetry of the
Civil War</cite> (one, an especially bitter one, is entitled “John
Bull, my jo John,”) but it would serve no useful purpose to
repeat them, now that the ill feeling has passed away with
the causes which led to it.</p>

<p>Mr. James R. Lowell’s dignified protest in the <cite>Biglow
Papers</cite> may, however, be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">JOHN BROWN’S BODY.</p>

<p>The origin of this celebrated anti-slavery song is obscure
and involved. John Brown attempted to incite the negroes
to rebel against slavery, and although he did not succeed in
this, he, with a few fanatical followers, seized a small fort
at Harper’s Ferry. The United States troops attacked
them, captured or killed Brown’s followers, and Brown
himself was hanged on December 2, 1859. Insignificant as
was this episode, it was the warning of the coming storm
between North and South, and was the death knell of
slavery. “John Brown’s Body” appears to have been first
adopted as a marching song by the Twelfth Massachusetts
Volunteers, commanded by Colonel Fletcher Webster. The
soldiers of this regiment sang it as they marched down
Broadway in New York, July 24, 1861, on their way from
Boston to the front.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE.</p>

<p>This song was written in 1862 just after President Lincoln
had issued a proclamation calling for 300,000 men to fill up
the ranks of his army. The author was Mr. John S. Gibbons,
a Quaker of New York. The poem was first published
anonymously, in the “Evening Post” New York, on July
16, 1862, and was then generally ascribed to William
Cullen Bryant, the editor of that paper.</p>

<p>This song was written in April, 1861, by Mr. James R.
Randall, a native of Baltimore, and first published in <cite>The
Delta</cite>, whence it was soon copied into every journal in the
Southern States.</p>

<p>It is sung to the tune of a favourite college song, entitled
“Lauriger Horatius,” which itself is borrowed from a
German air known as “Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum.”
Two young ladies, Miss H. Cary and Miss Jennie Cary,
first set it to music, and sung it to the Confederate troops in
their camp at Manassas.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">EDGAR ALLAN POE.</h3>

<p>Before leaving the American Poets a few
supplemental parodies of E. A. Poe may be
inserted here. His works were dealt with in
Volume <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> of this collection (Parts 14, 15, 16,
17, and 18), but since then, May 1885, several
excellent parodies of his poems have appeared,
besides which a few others have come to light
which had then escaped attention.</p>

<p><cite>Annabel Lee</cite> was printed on <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 61,
 <abbr title="Volume Two">Vol. II.</abbr>,
the following are some additional parodies
of it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<div class="i1">’Tis a dozen or so of years ago,</div>
<div class="i2">Somewhere in the west countree,</div>
<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a><span class="pageno">283</span>
<div class="i1">That a nice girl lived, as ye Hoosiers know</div>
<div class="i2">By the name of Deborah Lee:</div>
<div class="i1">Her sister was loved by Edgar Poe,</div>
<div class="i2">But Deborah by me.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now I was green, and she was green,</div>
<div class="i2">As a summer’s squash might be,</div>
<div class="i1">And we loved as warmly as other folks,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">I and my Deborah Lee,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">With a love that the lasses of Hoosierdom</div>
<div class="i2">Coveted her and me.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But somehow it happened a long time ago,</div>
<div class="i2">In the aguish West countree,</div>
<div class="i1">That a chill March morning gave the <em>shakes</em></div>
<div class="i2">To my beautiful Deborah Lee;</div>
<div class="i1">And the grim steam doctor (drat him!) came</div>
<div class="i2">And bore her away from me,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">The doctor and death, old partners they</div>
<div class="i2">In the aguish countree.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The angels wanted her in Heaven</div>
<div class="i2">(But they never asked for me),</div>
<div class="i1">And that is the reason, I rather guess,</div>
<div class="i2">In the aguish West countree,</div>
<div class="i1">That the cold March wind and the doctor and death,</div>
<div class="i2">Took off my Deborah Lee&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">My beautiful Deborah Lee&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">From the warm sunshine and the opening flower,</div>
<div class="i2">And bore her away from me.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Our love was as strong as a six horse team,</div>
<div class="i2">Or the love of folks older than we,</div>
<div class="i2">Or possibly wiser than we;</div>
<div class="i1">But death, with the aid of doctor and steam,</div>
<div class="i2">Was rather too many for me;</div>
<div class="i1">He closed the peepers and silenced the breath,</div>
<div class="i2">Of my sweetheart Deborah Lee,</div>
<div class="i1">And her form lies cold in the prairie mould,</div>
<div class="i2">Silent and cold&mdash;Ah me!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The foot of the hunter shall press her grave,</div>
<div class="i2">And the prairie’s sweet wild flowers,</div>
<div class="i1">In their odorous beauty around it wave,</div>
<div class="i2">Through all the sunny hours,</div>
<div class="i2">The still bright summer hours;</div>
<div class="i1">And the birds shall sing in the tufted grass,</div>
<div class="i2">And the nectar-laden bee,</div>
<div class="i1">With his dreamy hum on his gauze wings pass,</div>
<div class="i2">She wakes no more to me;</div>
<div class="i2">Ah! never more to me;</div>
<div class="i1">Though the wild birds sing and the wild flowers spring,</div>
<div class="i2">She wakes no more to me.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Yet oft in the hush of the dim still night,</div>
<div class="i2">A vision of beauty I see,</div>
<div class="i1">Gliding soft to my bedside,&mdash;a phantom of light,</div>
<div class="i2">Dear, beautiful Deborah Lee,</div>
<div class="i2">My bride that was to be;</div>
<div class="i1">And I wake to mourn that the doctor and death,</div>
<div class="i1">And the cold March wind should stop the breath</div>
<div class="i2">Of my darling Deborah Lee&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Adorable Deborah Lee&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">That angels should want her up in Heaven,</div>
<div class="i2">Before they wanted me.</div>

<div class="i1">And this is the reason, I happen to know,</div>

<div class="i1">And drenching me three times a day with the same&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">The horriblest bore that could be&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And shutting me up in my bedroom for hours,</div>
<div class="i2">With a tract and more Camomile Tea.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Even now, strange it seems, I have hideous dreams</div>

<div class="i1">Of its taste when I think I still shudder and shrink</div>
<div class="i2">At the nauseous Camomile Tea;</div>
<div class="i1">And I muse in amaze at that old woman’s craze,</div>
<div class="i2">On the loathing, the loathing I felt in those days,</div>

<div class="i3">In that cot with my Aunt Magee.</div>

<div class="i5">Here the drive is filled with swells&mdash;</div>
<div class="i7">Noble swells!</div>
<div class="i1">What a mass of snobbery their toggery fortells</div>
<div class="i5">How they snigger, snigger, snigger</div>
<div class="i7">In the spicy air of day</div>
<div class="i5">At the girls who cut a figure</div>

<div class="i7">And particularly gay.</div>
<div class="i5">In a trot, trot, trot</div>
<div class="i5">All about one spot</div>
<div class="i1">To the super-admiration, that so admirably tells</div>
<div class="i5">Of the swells, swells, swells, swells,</div>

<div class="i5">How they tap out their applause</div>
<div class="i5">At the prima donna’s notes</div>
<div class="i7">All in time.</div>
<div class="i5">While the liquid music floats</div>
<div class="i1">Till it filters in their mouths and down their throats</div>
<div class="i7">Oh, sublime!</div>

<div class="i5">Here’s a drawing-room of swells&mdash;</div>
<div class="i7">Grand swells!</div>
<div class="i1">What a world of slowness their society compels</div>
<div class="i5">In the brilliancy of night</div>
<div class="i5">Don’t we instantly take fright</div>
<div class="i1">At the melancholy drawling of their tone?</div>
<div class="i5">Lisping through their tender throats</div>
<div class="i5">Dwelling on their upper notes</div>
<div class="i7">All their own&mdash;</div>
<div class="i5">That we plebeianic people</div>
<div class="i5">Would be rather in a steeple</div>
<div class="i7">All alone</div>

<div class="i1">Or elsewhere at some grand christ’ning</div>
<div class="i5">Where the children shriek and groan.</div>

<div class="i5">Ever <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</i> “Lord Dundreary”</div>
<div class="i7">Always dolls</div>

<div class="i7">Lolls</div>
<div class="i5">In the presence of the belles</div>
<div class="i5">And his lisping voice it tells</div>
<div class="i5">Of the beauty of the belles</div>
<div class="i5">Who delight to dance with swells</div>
<div class="i5">Keeping time, time, time</div>
<div class="i5">In a manner quite sublime</div>
<div class="i5">To the joy of both the swells</div>
<div class="i7">And the belles;</div>
<div class="i5">Keeping time, time, time</div>
<div class="i5">With exactitude most prime</div>

<p>A parody entitled <cite>Christmas Bills</cite> appeared in “Pippins
and Cheese,” by Joseph Hatton; London, Bradbury,
Evans &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, 1868. Another, entitled <cite>The Yells</cite>, was
written for recitation by Mr. John C. Morgan, of Kenmure
Road, Hackney, and published by him, at the
moderate price of one penny. These are too long to give
in full, and extracts would not convey a fair idea of their
merits.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Raven” was given on <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 27, Volume
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, followed by numerous parodies. Since
1885 many others have been written, principally
on political topics, but unfortunately political
parodies are, as a rule, of only ephemeral
interest. Consequently only a few of the best
will be given complete, with extracts from
some of the others.</p>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">An Appeal.</span></div>
<div class="i1">Once upon a midnight dreary, Gilbert pondered weak and weary,</div>
<div class="i1">Thinking of a curious title his new Comic Opera for,</div>
<div class="i1">When a volume from him flinging, suddenly there came a ringing,</div>
<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><span class="pageno">287</span>
<div class="i1">As of some one madly clinging to the bell at his front door;</div>
<div class="i1">“It is D’Oyly Carte,” he muttered, “ringing at my big front door,</div>
<div class="i5">Merely this and nothing more.”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Poking then the glowing ember, for ’twas  cold as bleak December,</div>
<div class="i1">Gilbert said “Ah, I remember in the olden time of yore,</div>
<div class="i1">Yea, and shall forget it never, though I were to live for ever,</div>
<div class="i1">How I vainly did endeavour once to see my ‘Pinafore,’</div>
<div class="i1">Sat and suffered awful anguish in the stalls at ‘Pinafore,’</div>
<div class="i5">Just that once, but nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“For the feeling&mdash;sad, uncertain&mdash;at the rising of the curtain,</div>
<div class="i1">Thrilled me, filled me with such terrors, that a solemn oath I swore,</div>
<div class="i1">And the oath have oft repeated, that though kings and queens entreated,</div>
<div class="i1">I would ne’er again be seated in the stalls as once before,</div>
<div class="i1">There to try and see the piece through, as I tried to do before,</div>
<div class="i5">Now to do so nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Open here was flung the portal by a pompous powdered mortal,</div>
<div class="i1">Who then ushered Mr. Carte in, as he oft had done before;</div>
<div class="i1">Not a moment stopped or stayed he, but a slight obeisance made he,</div>
<div class="i1">And in voice of thunder said he, “Mr. Carte”&mdash;then slammed the door,</div>
<div class="i1">And in tones stentorian said he, “Mr. Carte,”&mdash;then slammed the door.</div>
<div class="i5">Only this and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Mr. Carte then said quite coolly, “Mr. Gilbert, tell me truly,</div>
<div class="i1">Have you found a proper title our new Comic Opera for?</div>
<div class="i1">Tell this soul with sorrow laden, as you hope to go to Aidenn,</div>
<div class="i1">Have you really, really made ’un? Tell, O tell me, I implore!</div>
<div class="i1">Tell me what its funny name is&mdash;tell, O tell me, I implore!”</div>
<div class="i5">Answered Gilbert&mdash;“Ruddygore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Carte uprose, alarmed, astounded, by this title much confounded,</div>
<div class="i1">For this word of dreadful meaning such a world of horror bore;</div>
<div class="i1">And he said, “This title gruesome, I feel very sure will do some</div>
<div class="i1">Injury, and we shall lose some thousands ere this piece is o’er</div>
<div class="i1">Such a name will surely ruin both your words and Arthur’s score;</div>
<div class="i5">Therefore change it, I implore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then said Gilbert, calmly smoking, “D’Oyly Carte, you must be joking;</div>
<div class="i1">I have never found a title that I liked so much before,</div>
<div class="i1">For it gives the play the seeming of a drama that is teeming</div>
<div class="i1">With deeds of blood all streaming, which the people gloat so o’er;</div>
<div class="i1">Of those deeds all grim and ghastly that the people gloat so o’er;</div>
<div class="i5">Therefore be it Ruddygore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And with title so unfitting, people still are nightly sitting</div>
<div class="i1">In the gallery, stalls, and boxes, from the ceiling to the floor;</div>
<div class="i1">And although they can’t help glancing at D. Lely when he’s dancing,</div>
<div class="i1">Think Miss Brandram’s song entrancing, and give Grosssmith an encore,</div>
<div class="i1">Still all cry, “Oh, Gilbert, Gilbert, change this title “Ruddygore.”</div>
<div class="i5">Not in spelling&mdash;we want more.”</div>
<div class="author2"><cite>The Pall Mall Gazette.</cite></div>

<p>About a week after the production of <cite>Ruddygore</cite> (January,
1887), when both the opera and its title were being adversely
criticised, Mr. Gilbert jocularly remarked: “I propose
altering the title of the piece, and calling it ‘<cite>Kensington
Gore; or, Not so good as the Mikado</cite>.’”</p>

<div class="i3">(A curious wild mercurial tapping).</div>
<div class="i3">’Twas the postman’s double rapping,</div>
<div class="i5">Rapping at the big front door.</div>
<div class="i6">Only this, and nothing more.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">But it brought to me a feeling</div>
<div class="i3">Ever growing&mdash;never healing&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">“Still so gently o’er me stealing,”</div>
<div class="i5">Which I’d often felt before.</div>
<div class="i3">The Academy were sending</div>
<div class="i3">Round those cards, those never-ending</div>
<div class="i3">Monitors to the offending</div>
<div class="i5">Limners they’d turned out before.</div>
<div class="i6">This it was&mdash;and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">As I sat there, half demented,</div>
<div class="i3">Our Jemima Ann presented</div>
<div class="i1">Several letters which were left me by that postman at the door;</div>
<div class="i3">And amongst them lay the verdict</div>
<div class="i3">The Academy had sent me,</div>
<div class="i3">And I swooned upon the floor&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Simply this&mdash;and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">Rising, on the verge of madness,</div>
<div class="i3">Should I&mdash;courting joy or sadness&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Find it now by bursting open the portentous seal it bore;</div>
<div class="i3">Or, in frenzy, should I burn it,</div>
<div class="i3">Or to the R. A.’s return it,</div>
<div class="i3">And their secrecy implore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Their forgiveness&mdash;Evermore!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">Or still feeling that without full</div>
<div class="i3">Knowledge, if a <em>Cross or Doubtful</em></div>
<div class="i1">Might be lurking in the missive I’ve adverted to before,</div>
<div class="i3">Should I tenderly unfold it,</div>
<div class="i3">And in trembling digits hold it</div>
<div class="i3">To confront me Evermore</div>
<div class="i6">With its verdict&mdash;Evermore!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">Musing thus, I opened wide the</div>
<div class="i3">Envelope, and looked inside the</div>

<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a><span class="pageno">288</span>
<div class="i3">’Twas the varnishing permission</div>

<p>On October 31, 1886, <cite>The Weekly Dispatch</cite> (London),
published five parodies on the “Raven” sent in for competition.
The prize of two guineas was awarded to the
following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Once beneath a tree at Hawarden, while I pondered in my garden</div>
<div class="i2">Over many a quaint and curious volume of Homeric lore.</div>
<div class="i1">While I nodded, nearly napping, came a noise like distant tapping,</div>
<div class="i2">Or shillelaghs gently rapping, on the verdant Shannon shore.</div>
<div class="i2">“’Tis more Irishmen,” I muttered, “from the verdant Shannon shore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Home Rulers, and nothing more!”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Ah, distinctly I remember&mdash;’twas  in Eighty-six, November,</div>
<div class="i2">After every “Union” member had conspired my bill to floor&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">In a state of agitation, I sought some vaticination</div>
<div class="i2">Which should show me if the nation would their G.O.M. restore:</div>
<div class="i2">If the public their old leader would to place and power restore</div>
<div class="i6">Once again, or nevermore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Once again I heard the tapping; then, his ebon pinions flapping,</div>
<div class="i2">O’er the wall there flew a Raven, of the stormy days of yore.</div>
<div class="i1">An old bird of aspect cheeky, with a croak extremely creaky,</div>
<div class="i2">And a bill extremely “Beaky,” and a curl that hung before,</div>
<div class="i2">Like the curl once worn by Dizzy, which, you know, hung down before,</div>
<div class="i6">And he croaked out “Nevermore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then methought the air grew denser, and he changed to Mr. Spencer,</div>
<div class="i2">And he gibbered, ghostly, ghoul-like, on the garden’s tufted floor.</div>
<div class="i1">“Wretch!” I cried, “from distant Berlin, cease thy fierce moustache from twirlin’;</div>
<div class="i2">Tell me, for my brain is whirlin’, will the Fates my power restore?</div>
<div class="i2">Will the dissidents surrender and once more my power restore?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore!”</div>

<div class="i1">Once upon an evening dreary, as I pondered worn and weary</div>
<div class="i2">Over many a dusty packet of unsettled bills of yore,</div>
<div class="i1">As I sat serenely rocking, thinking it was very shocking,</div>
<div class="i2">Suddenly I heard a knocking&mdash;knocking at my study door.</div>
<div class="i2">“’Tis my tailor gay,” I muttered, “knocking at my study door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Only this, and nothing more.”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Ah! distinct my recollection, for I had a chest affection&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Out of cash&mdash;and in dejection I was gazing at the floor!</div>
<div class="i1">Vainly I had tried to borrow half-a-crown to meet the morrow,</div>
<div class="i2">But discovered, to my sorrow, none would trust me any more&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">From the too-confiding butcher to my tailor, tradesmen swore</div>
<div class="i6">They would trust me&mdash;nevermore!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then, my study door unbolting, in there stepped, with bow revolting,</div>
<div class="i2">He, my stern, relentless tailor, whom, I fear, I hated sore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Made a most polite oration&mdash;didn’t show the least vexation&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">As he calmly took his station just within my study door,</div>
<div class="i2">With his bill upon the matting just within my study door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Merely waited&mdash;nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Tailor,” cried I. “Imp of evil! Tailor still, or else the Devil,</div>
<div class="i2">Whether Satan sent thee&mdash;whether ’bus thy body hither bore;</div>
<div class="i1">Standing in thy frock-coat braided on my carpet very faded&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Having this my den invaded, tell me truly, I implore.”</div>
<div class="i2">Is there, is there trust no longer? Tell me, truly, I implore.”</div>

<div class="i1">Yes, ’tis he of frame Titanic, massive jowl, and sneer Satanic,</div>

<div class="i2">As he slowly strutted past me, perching o’er my chamber door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Perched upon a bust of Schnadhorst&mdash;somewhat broken&mdash;o’er the door,</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The Yankee Cryptogram.</span></div>
<div class="poemdivider"><cite>A Tale of Shakespeare’s Bacon.</cite></div>
<div class="i1">Once within an autumn dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,</div>
<div class="i2">Of the only actress playing in my half-forgotten lore,</div>
<div class="i1">While I nodded&mdash;nearly napping, which is something oft does happen,</div>
<div class="i2">When some actors try the tapping, tapping of my written lore;</div>
<div class="i2">Someone muttered, “Not his writing.” This has sure been said before.</div>
<div class="i5">Only this, and nothing more.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">Open then I flung the shutter, and with many a flirt and flutter,</div>
<div class="i2">In there stepped a lengthy Yankee from Columbia’s shore;</div>
<div class="i1">Not the least obeisance made he, not an instant stopped or stayed he;</div>
<div class="i2">But with haste like all the Yankees, wrote a book about my plays;</div>
<div class="i2">Wrote that it was Francis Bacon who had written all my plays,</div>
<div class="i5">Wrote and wrote, and nothing more.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then the Yankee scribe beguiling all my sad soul into smiling</div>
<div class="i2">By the queer and strange arrangement of the nonsense that he wrote.</div>
<div class="i1">“Though thy pate’s unshorn, unshaven, thou,” I said, must be a craven,</div>
<div class="i2">Ghastly, grim, and lengthy Yankee, wandering from Atlantic’s shore,</div>
<div class="i2">“Tell me what thy lordly name is on the night’s Baconian shore?”</div>
<div class="i5">“Donnelly, and nothing more.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then the Yankee creature, holding Bacon’s bust, spoke only</div>
<div class="i2">One long word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.</div>
<div class="i1">Nothing further then he uttered, not a pamphlet even fluttered,</div>
<div class="i2">Till I scarcely more than muttered, “Other men wrote thus before;</div>
<div class="i2">On the morrow he will leave me as the others did before.”</div>
<div class="i5">Said the Yankee, “Crypto! More!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Startled at the stillness broken by the words so oddly spoken,</div>
<div class="i2">“Doubtless,” said I, “what he utters is his only stock and store,</div>
<div class="i1">Caught from an unhappy master, who some shocking brain disaster,</div>
<div class="i2">Turned into a poetaster, till his thoughts one burden bore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Till the echoes of his thoughts one melancholy burden bore</div>
<div class="i5">Of Crypto&mdash;cryptogram!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed by an unseen censer,</div>
<div class="i2">Swung by creatures whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.</div>
<div class="i1">Romeo cried, “Shakespeare hath sent me, to the world <em>he</em> lent me,</div>
<div class="i2">Showing through me and Juliet how it is true lovers love.</div>
<div class="i2">Leave, oh leave thy stupid fiction, and forget this cryptogram.”</div>
<div class="i5">Quoth the Yankee “Nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“I am Richard! Man of evil! Hero still, though fiend and devil!</div>
<div class="i2">Whether tempter sent, or ill wind blew thee to our shore;</div>
<div class="i1">Take my word&mdash;me all undaunted&mdash;see Macbeth on ground enchanted,</div>
<div class="i2">Poor Macbeth by Banquo haunted&mdash;see them with a hundred more!</div>
<div class="i2">Hamlet and his murdered sire! Leave him, leave him, I implore.”</div>
<div class="i5">Quoth the Yankee “Nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Said Orlando, “Thing of evil! Yankee man, be civil!</div>
<div class="i2">By the heaven that bends above us, by the God we both adore,</div>
<div class="i1">Tell this soul all loving-laden, do you think that Francis Bacon</div>
<a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a><span class="pageno">290</span>
<div class="i2">Could have made a sainted maiden, like the one called Rosalind?</div>
<div class="i2">Made a fair and radiant maiden like to Shakespeare’s Rosalind?”</div>
<div class="i5">Quoth the Yankee “Cryptogram.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Be that word our sign of parting, Yankee fiend,” I shrieked, upstarting;</div>
<div class="i2">“Get thee back to Sampson Low’s, or your own Atlantic shore,</div>
<div class="i1">Leave no proof-sheet as a token of the lie that you have spoken,</div>
<div class="i2">Leave my glory still unbroken, take that bust without my door,</div>
<div class="i2">Take thy book from off the press, and that bust without my door.”</div>
<div class="i5">Quoth the Yankee “Nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And that Yankee never sitting, still is flitting, still is flitting,</div>
<div class="i2">With the pallid bust of Bacon to and from his printer’s door,</div>
<div class="i1">And his tale has all the seeming of a madman who is dreaming,</div>
<div class="i2">And the Crypto o’er him streaming, holds him wriggling on the floor</div>
<div class="i2">And his book from out that Crypto wriggling with him on the floor</div>

<p>Mr. Donnelly’s ingenious, but absurd, theory that what
we call Shakespeare’s plays were written by Bacon, has been
utterly demolished by Dr. Nicholson, in “No Cipher in
Shakespeare” (London, T. Fisher Unwin.) The theory was
also most amusingly parodied in <cite>The Cornhill Magazine</cite> for
August, 1888. In an article entitled “Who wrote Dickens’s
Novels” it was demonstrated, on Mr. Donnelly’s system, that
they were certainly written by Mr. W. E. Gladstone.</p>

<div class="i1">Once within my little study,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_137"
id="fnanchor_137"></a><a href="#footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></span> while the firelight gleaming ruddy</div>
<div class="i2">Threw fantastic lights and shadows on the wall and on the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">I was thinking of two nations that for many generations</div>
<div class="i2">Had known nought but deadly hatred and contentions sad and sore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Nought but deadly strife and hatred and contentions sad and sore,</div>
<div class="i5">Going on for evermore.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And I thought, all this is blameful, ’tis not only sad but shameful,</div>
<div class="i2">All this plundering and oppressing and this spilling lakes of gore,</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis the nation that is stronger that has been the other’s wronger,</div>
<div class="i2">Let her play this part no longer, but this cruelty give o’er,</div>
<div class="i2">Turn to ways of love and kindness, and this cruelty give o’er,</div>
<div class="i5">And have peace for evermore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">While unto myself thus speaking, on the stairs I heard a creaking</div>
<div class="i2">As of someone softly sneaking up to listen at the door;</div>
<div class="i1">Then said I, “You need not fear me, you can just come in and hear me,</div>
<div class="i2">Take a seat or stand a-near me, let us talk this matter o’er&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">’Tis a grave and serious subject, let us talk it calmly o’er,”</div>
<div class="i5">Then I opened wide the door.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then a being thin and shanky, white of visage, tall and lanky</div>
<div class="i2">Looking ill at ease and cranky, came and stood upon the floor;</div>
<div class="i1">In his hands some keys he dangled, keys that harshly clinked and jangled,</div>
<div class="i2">And over his right optic a large pane of glass he wore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">When it fell, he slowly raised it, and replaced it as before&mdash;</div>
<div class="i5">This he did and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Now,” said I, the shape addressing, “don’t you think ’twould be a blessing</div>
<div class="i2">If this Anglo-Irish conflict coming down from days of yore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">If this age-long woe and sadness could be changed to peace and gladness</div>
<div class="i2">And the holy ties of friendship could be knit from shore to shore</div>
<div class="i2">And no words but words of kindness pass across from shore to shore!”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i5">Quoth the lank one, “Tullamore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">At this word I marvelled truly, for it seemed to come unduly</div>
<div class="i2">As a misplaced exhibition of his geographic lore;</div>
<div class="i1">So my thread of thought resuming, I said, “There are dangers looming</div>
<div class="i2">Over England’s wide dominion that ’tis useless to ignore,</div>
<div class="i2">What shall strengthen and sustain her when the battle-thunders roar?”</div>
<div class="i5">Answer made he, “Tullamore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then said I, “Across the waters Erin’s faithful sons and daughters</div>
<div class="i2">Now have fierce and bitter memories burning in each bosom’s core,</div>
<div class="i1">Think what peace and joy would fill them and what happiness would thrill them</div>
<div class="i2">If but England yielded freedom to the land that they adore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">If she spoke the word of freedom to the land her souls adore”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i5">But <em>his</em> word was “Tullamore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Think,” said I, “of England’s masses; every day that o’er them passes</div>
<div class="i2">Hears their murmurings and complainings swelling louder than before,</div>
<div class="i1">They object&mdash;and ’tis no wonder&mdash;to the rule of force and plunder</div>
<div class="i2">That so long has kept them under, squeezing blood from every pore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Have you any word of comfort that their patience may restore?”</div>
<div class="i5">His reply was “Tullamore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a><span class="pageno">291</span>
<div class="i1">From my vision quick he glided; in my heart I then decided</div>
<div class="i2">That if this was England’s message by this popinjay brought o’er,</div>
<div class="i1">She had missed a chance of glory that would brighten all her story&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">But, I said, that lanky Tory was a humbug and a bore:</div>
<div class="i2">These words from both the peoples soon will ring from shore to shore&mdash;</div>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Leonainie.</span></p>

<p>On April 28, 1886, <cite>The Daily News</cite> (London),
published the following curious story about
E. A. Poe:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<cite>The New York Critic</cite> has unearthed a story From <cite>The
Dispatch</cite> of Kokomo about the youth of the author of ‘The
Raven.’ There dwells a man in Kokomo (Ind.) whose grandfather
kept a tavern in Chesterfield, near Richmond (Va.).
The story states that, at the Chesterfield tavern, a dissipated-looking
young man presented himself one evening about
fifty years ago, and asked for a bedroom. When the servant
went to call him in the morning he had disappeared, without
the prosaic ceremony of settling his bill. In place of that
he had left a book with a poem written on the fly-leaf ‘as
legible as print.’ Now Edgar Poe’s handwriting was as

legible as Thackeray’s, wonderfully clear and beautiful.
The poem was signed E. A. P. We quote the first verse,
and leave experts to decide whether it is, or is not, by
Poe:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Leonainie, angels named her,</div>
<div class="i2">And they took the light</div>
<div class="i1">Of the laughing stars, and framed her</div>
<div class="i2">In a smile of white,</div>
<div class="i1">And they made her hair of gloomy</div>
<div class="i1">Midnight, and her eyes of bloomy</div>
<div class="i1">Moonshine, and they brought her to me</div>
<div class="i4">In a solemn night.</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="blockquote unindent">Here the angels and the absurd sonorous name Leonainie,
and the midnight, are all very like Edgar Poe’s manner, and
very like his usual sentiment is the conclusion, when</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">My Leonainie drifted</div>
<div class="i2">From me in a dream.</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="blockquote unindent">But whether the resemblances are beyond the reach of
parody it were rash to pronounce.”</p>

<p>During his lifetime the inward application of spirits had
a very bad effect upon Poe, and since his death spirits have
done much to injure his reputation. It was bad enough for
Miss Lizzie Doten and Dr. J. Garth Wilkinson to palm off
their melodious twaddle as inspired by the spirit of Poe, the
poems were nonsense, it is true, but nonsense written by
educated persons. Whereas a work, published in New York
twenty years ago, purporting to have been dictated by the
spirits of deceased authors, contained a poem by the ghost
of Poe which is noteworthy for the absence of any sense,
and for the presence of grammatical errors which Poe, when
living, would never have perpetrated.</p>

<p>As an authentic “spirit poem” it is curious, showing how
Poets deteriorate when in Hades. The book is entitled
“<cite>Strange Visitors</cite>,” dictated by Spirits through a Clairvoyant.
New York, G. W. Carleton, publisher, 1869.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Born</span>, December 6, 1788. | <span class="sc">Died</span>,
 June 17, 1845.</p>

<p>The author of the “Ingoldsby Legends”
was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford,
he entered the Church, and eventually became
a Canon of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s Cathedral, London. He
wrote for <cite>John Bull</cite>, <cite>Blackwood</cite>, <cite>Bentley’s Miscellany</cite>,
and was, for a time, editor of the <cite>London
Chronicle</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>Bentley’s Miscellany</cite> was established in 1837,
and in it appeared the famous “Ingoldsby
Legends,” a collection of poems unique for
their fun and originality.</p>

<p>Popular phrases, the most prosaic sentences,
the cramped technicalities of legal diction, and
snatches of various languages are worked in
with an apparent absence of all art or effort;
not a word seems out of place, not an expression
forced, whilst syllables the most intractable
find the only partners fitted for them
throughout the range of our language. These
Legends have often been imitated, but never
equalled.</p>

<div class="i1">’Twas in Margate last July, I walked upon the pier,</div>
<div class="i1">I saw a little vulgar Boy&mdash;I said, “What make you here?</div>
<div class="i1">The gloom upon your youthful cheek speaks anything but joy;”</div>
<div class="i1">Again I said, “What make you here, you little vulgar Boy?”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He frown’d, that little vulgar boy,&mdash;he deem’d I meant to scoff&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And when the little heart is big, a little “sets it off:”</div>
<div class="i1">He put his finger in his mouth, his little bosom rose&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">He had no little handkerchief to wipe his little nose!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Hark! don’t you hear, my little man,&mdash;it’s striking Nine,” I said,</div>
<div class="i1">“An hour when all good little boys and girls should be in bed,</div>
<div class="i1">Run home and get your supper, else your Ma will scold&mdash;Oh! fie!</div>
<div class="i1">It is very wrong indeed for little boys to stand and cry!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The tear-drop in his little eye again began to spring,</div>
<div class="i1">His bosom throbb’d with agony,&mdash;he cried like anything.</div>
<div class="i1">I stoop’d, and thus amidst his sobs I heard him murmur&mdash;“Ah!</div>
<div class="i1">I haven’t got no supper! and I haven’t got no Ma!!&mdash;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“My father, he is on the seas,&mdash;my mother’s dead and gone!</div>
<div class="i1">And I am here, on this here pier to roam the world alone;</div>
<div class="i1">I have not had, this live-long day, one drop to cheer my heart,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor ‘<em>brown</em>’ to buy a bit of bread with,&mdash;let alone a tart.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“If there’s a soul will give me food, or find me in employ,</div>
<div class="i1">By day and night, then blow me tight!” (he was a vulgar Boy;)</div>
<div class="i1">“And now I’m here, from this here pier it is my fixed intent</div>
<div class="i1">To jump, as Mister Levi did from off the Monument!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Cheer up! cheer up! my little man&mdash;cheer up!” I kindly said,</div>
<div class="i1">“You are a naughty boy to take such things into your head:</div>
<div class="i1">If you should jump from off the pier, you’d surely break your legs,</div>
<div class="i1">Perhaps your neck&mdash;then Bogey’d have you, sure as eggs are eggs!</div>

<div class="i1">“Come home with me, my little man, come home with me and sup,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I took him home to Number 2, the house beside “The Foy,”</div>
<div class="i1">I bade him wipe his dirty shoes,&mdash;that little vulgar Boy,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And then I said to Mistress Jones, the kindest of her sex,</div>
<div class="i1">“Pray be so good as go and fetch a pint of double X!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But Mrs. Jones was rather cross, she made a little noise,</div>
<div class="i1">She said “she did not like to wait on little vulgar Boys.”</div>
<div class="i1">She with her apron wiped the plates, and as she rubb’d the delf</div>
<div class="i1">Said I might “go to Jericho, and fetch the beer myself!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I did not go to Jericho&mdash;I went to Mr. Cobb&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">I changed a shilling&mdash;(which in town the people call “a Bob”)&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">It was not so much for myself as for that vulgar child&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And I said, “A pint of double X, and please to draw it mild!”&mdash;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">When I came back I gazed about&mdash;I gazed on stool and chair&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">I could not see my little friend&mdash;because he was not there!</div>
<div class="i1">I peep’d beneath the table-cloth&mdash;beneath the sofa <span class="lock">too&mdash;</span></div>
<div class="i1">I said, “You little vulgar Boy! why, what’s become of you?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I could not see my table-spoons&mdash;I look’d, but could not see</div>
<div class="i1">The little fiddle-pattern’d ones I use when I’m at tea;&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">I could not see my sugar-tongs&mdash;my silver watch&mdash;oh dear!</div>
<div class="i1">I know ’twas  on the mantel-piece when I went out for beer.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I could not see my Macintosh&mdash;it was not to be <span class="lock">seen!&mdash;</span></div>
<div class="i1">Nor yet my best white beaver hat, broad brimm’d and lined with green;</div>
<div class="i1">My carpet-bag&mdash;my cruet-stand, that holds my sauce and soy,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">My roast potatoes! all are gone!&mdash;and so’s that vulgar Boy!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I rang the bell for Mrs. Jones, for she was down below,</div>
<div class="i1">“Oh, Mrs. Jones, what <em>do</em> you think?&mdash;ain’t this a pretty go?&mdash;</div>

<div class="poemdivider"><hr class="shorter" /></div>
<div class="i1">Next morning I was up betimes&mdash;I sent the Crier round,</div>
<div class="i1">All with his bell and gold-laced hat, to say I’d give a pound</div>
<div class="i1">To find that little vulgar boy, who’d gone and used me so;</div>
<div class="i1">But when the crier cried, “O yes!” the people cried, “O, No!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I went to “Jarvis’ Landing-place,” the glory of the town,</div>
<div class="i1">There was a common sailor-man a-walking up and down,</div>
<div class="i1">I told my tale&mdash;he seem’d to think I’d not been treated well,</div>
<div class="i1">And call’d me “Poor old Buffer!” what that means I cannot tell.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The sailor-man he said he’d seen that morning on the shore,</div>
<div class="i1">A son of something&mdash;’twas  a name I’d never heard before,</div>
<div class="i1">A little “gallows-looking chap”&mdash;dear me, what could he mean?</div>
<div class="i1">With a “carpet swab” and “muckingtogs” and a hat turn’d up with green.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He spoke about his “precious eyes,” and said he’d seen him “sheer,”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">It’s very odd that sailor-men should talk so very <span class="lock">queer&mdash;</span></div>
<div class="i1">And then he hitch’d his trousers up, as is, I’m told, their use,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">It’s very odd that sailor-men should wear those things so loose.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I did not understand him well, but think he meant to say</div>
<div class="i1">He’d seen that little vulgar Boy, that morning swim away</div>
<div class="i1">In Captain Large’s Royal George, about an hour before,</div>
<div class="i1">And they were now, as he supposed, “some<em>wheres</em>” about the Nore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A landsman said, “I <em>twig</em> the chap&mdash;he’s been upon the Mill&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And ’cause he <em>gammons</em> so the <em>flats</em>, ve calls him Veeping Bill!”</div>
<div class="i1">He said, “he’d done me wery brown,” and nicely “<em>stow’d the swag</em>,”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">That’s French, I fancy, for a hat&mdash;or else a carpet-bag.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I went and told the constable my property to track:</div>
<div class="i1">He ask’d me if “I didn’t wish that I might get it back?”</div>
<div class="i1">I answer’d “To be sure I do!&mdash;it’s what I’m come about.”</div>
<div class="i1">He smiled and said, “Sir, does your mother know that you are out?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Not knowing what to do, I thought I’d hasten back to town,</div>
<div class="i1">And beg our own Lord Mayor to catch the Boy who’d done me brown.</div>
<div class="i1">His Lordship very kindly said he’d try and find him out,</div>
<div class="i1">But he rather thought that there were several vulgar boys about.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He sent for Mr. Withair then, and I described “the swag,”</div>
<div class="i1">My Macintosh, my sugar-tongs, my spoons, and carpetbag;</div>
<div class="i1">He promised that the New Police should all their powers employ!</div>

<div class="i1">He laughed, that vulgar little boy&mdash;a roguish laugh had he&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">He said, “The School Board schools are not for vulgar boys like me.”</div>
<div class="i1">He put his finger to his nose his impudence to crown,</div>
<div class="i1">And asked me “if I could’nt give a little kid a brown?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Hark! don’t you hear, my little man, it’s really striking three?&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">An hour when boys should be at school to learn their A B C.</div>
<div class="i1">The School Board man will take you up but only for your good,</div>
<div class="i1">And <em>make</em> you go to school.” Says he, “I only wish he would.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“If there’s a school for such as me will teach me how to write,</div>
<div class="i1">And read and spell and do a sum, I should be then all right,</div>
<div class="i1">I should be jolly glad, for then I might find some employ;</div>
<div class="i1">But Walker as to that!” says he&mdash;he was a vulgar boy.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I gave that boy a sixpence. Passing on I heard him cry,</div>
<div class="i1">“Ain’t that old buffer werry kind!&mdash;oh, ain’t he? Oh, my eye!”</div>
<div class="i1">And then he turned a somersault, which boys a “coach-wheel” call:</div>
<div class="i1">He was not so ungrateful, though so vulgar, after all.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Revolving this within my mind, next morn I thought it fit</div>
<div class="i1">To seek the river Palace&mdash;where the School Board people sit.</div>
<div class="i1">I thought I’d go and tell them as they hadn’t found it out,</div>
<div class="i1">That loit’ring in the streets they might find several boys about</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">That I had heard the School Board schools were meant for such as these,</div>
<div class="i1">And not for little undergrads to go and take degrees;</div>
<div class="i1">But schools where London’s little lads might go and learn to write</div>
<div class="i1">And read, and vulgar little boys be taught to be polite.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a><span class="pageno">295</span>
<div class="i1">I gave my card, was ushered in, and told to take a chair;</div>
<div class="i1">I saw a portly gentleman&mdash;it might be the Lord Mayor;</div>
<div class="i1">I told him of these vulgar boys, and plainly put my case.</div>
<div class="i1">He laughed, that portly gentleman&mdash;he laughed right in my face.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“We do not care for vulgar boys,” he said. “We use our powers</div>
<div class="i1">To shut up private schools, and get their pupils into ours.</div>
<div class="i1">We go in for ‘accomplishments,’ for music, and&mdash;who knows?&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Some day a School Board pupil may an opera compose!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I said, “I thought it might be so (for rules true Genius spurns),</div>
<div class="i1">And from the gutters there might spring another Robert Burns.”</div>
<div class="i1">But still he shook his portly head, and said, “Don’t make a fuss,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“’Tis not on vulgar little boys that we spend every year</div>
<div class="i1">Four hundred thousand pounds. You see that education’s dear,</div>
<div class="i1">And is not to be wasted upon every boy you meet</div>
<div class="i1">Sweeping crossings, selling matches, loafing, begging in the street.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I said, “I thought the Act was passed that vulgar boys might share</div>
<div class="i1">Some little education, that they couldn’t get elsewhere</div>
<div class="i1">That schools might fill, and gaols, in time might really empty be.”</div>
<div class="i1">He said, “Well, now we’ve <em>got</em> the Act, that’s what we cannot see.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now, ratepayers, when election comes, remember to a man</div>
<div class="i1">Who caused all this extravagance&mdash;return them if you can;</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">Misadventures at the Mansion House.</span></div>
<div class="poemdivider"><cite>A Legend of the City.</cite></div>
<div class="i1">’Twas at Guildhall, a year ago, I chanced to hear a cheer,</div>
<div class="i1">And saw an Alderman stand forth; thought I: “What make you here?”</div>
<div class="i1">There was upon his face a look of somewhat common joy;</div>
<div class="i1">Again I thought: “Oh, can it be, you ever were a boy?”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But, strange to say, they cheer’d him still, and gave him such applause,</div>
<div class="i1">I looked into his face again, to try and seek the cause;</div>
<div class="i1">Till some one in a wig announced he had not pass’d the chair,</div>
<div class="i1">And asked the citizens if they would make him their Lord Mayor.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">They said they would; I’m bound to say I didn’t like the plan,</div>
<div class="i1">He seem’d to be, you see, a very pompous Alderman!</div>
<div class="i1">And put on very bumptious airs, and puff’d his shirt front out;</div>
<div class="i1">Twas sad to hear the h’s that he thickly dropp’d about.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Come, rule o’er us,” the Cits exclaim’d, “and be our new Lord Mayor,</div>
<div class="i1">And to the Mansion House we beg you to at once repair;</div>
<div class="i1">You’ll find the City annals there, its prestige and its fame,</div>
<div class="i1">And bear in mind that for a year we trust you with the same.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Well, he went to the Mansion House, amidst fresh marks of joy.</div>
<div class="i1">That pompous Alderman, who must have been, years since, a boy.</div>
<div class="i1">And there the City, with the trust and kindness that it shows,</div>
<div class="i1">Left him to do as he thought best, and did not interpose.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Some Aldermen were rather cross, and made a little noise,</div>
<div class="i1">And held themselves in readiness to be a counterpoise.</div>
<div class="i1">But meanwhile left him to himself, and murmur’d: “We shall see!”</div>
<div class="i1">And sundry ominous remarks when at their calipee.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">I had to go to Jericho, and stay’d ten months or so,</div>
<div class="i1">And once more chanced, on my return, towards the Bank to go,</div>
<div class="i1">When passing by the Mansion House I saw a crowd about,</div>
<div class="i1">And heard a citizen remark: “Well, here’s a nice set out!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He seemed of some important fact to have his civic head full;</div>
<div class="i1">“What’s up?” I asked. Said he: “Oh lor’! he’s served the City dreadful!”</div>
<div class="i1">“Who? what?” I cried, and thereupon the citizen began:</div>
<div class="i1">“Why, don’t you know? I mean, of course, the pompous Alderman!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“He’s served you badly, eh?” said I; the citizen replied:</div>
<div class="i1">“Oh, yes; he has done much to wound our ancient City’s pride.</div>
<div class="i1">Our name of hospitality, no trace of it is left!”</div>
<div class="i1">And taking out his handkerchief I noticed that he wept.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“I’ve just been in the Mansion House,” said he, “and have look’d round;</div>
<div class="i1">’Twas really very sad indeed, the state of things I found.</div>
<div class="i1">There’s all our Civic Prestige gone; of National Respect,</div>
<div class="i1">Although I searched both high and low, I could no sign detect.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Of Popular Esteem, too, now there seems no stock, I see;</div>
<div class="i1">And very little ‘Charity’ to what there used to be;</div>
<div class="i1">He’s even stripped the very Chair&mdash;the one in which he sat&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Of its Traditions; did you ever hear the like of that?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“There’s nothing left worth mentioning of all we valued so;</div>
<div class="i1">Now can you wonder that I say, ‘Now, here’s a pretty go!’</div>
<div class="i1">That pompous, stubborn Alderman, to so our trust requite,</div>
<div class="i1">And turn upon the City thus!” Said I: “It serves you right!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“It serves you right!” said I again. “The chair you should not fill.</div>
<div class="i1">With men like this; their very ways suspicion should instil.</div>
<div class="i1">Your City should have shown more sense, and had sufficient <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nous</i>,</div>
<div class="i1">To know that he should never be throned at the Mansion House.”</div>

<p>The following appeared in <cite>Punch</cite>, August 13, 1881, with
a cartoon, by Sambourne, representing the pedantic, pompous,
prosy, priggish Duke of Argyll, in Highland Costume,
“taking a sight” and putting out his tongue at the occupants
of the Treasury Bench, whom he has just styled “Jelly-fish”:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">It was a little vulgar boy, exceeding sharp, and Scotch,</div>
<div class="i1">At Westminster Aquarium he stood the fish to watch.</div>
<div class="i1">He willingly had got at them, but, helpless so to do,</div>
<div class="i1">Indulged, <em>like</em> little vulgar boys in general, in “<em>Yah-boo!</em>”</div>
<div class="i1">He was a very cock-nosed boy, which tempted him, no doubt,</div>
<div class="i1">“To put his thumb unto that nose, and spread his fingers out.”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Says he, “O yus, you <em>look</em> O.K.” (the boy meant “Orl Korrect”)</div>
<div class="i1">“You fancy you’re big whales and things with backbones, I expect.</div>
<div class="i1">Yah-boo! you flabby, flopping, floundering flats, as limp as small,</div>
<div class="i1">You’re only helpless jelly-fish, with not no spines at all!”</div>
<div class="i1">The creatures in the Tank appeared his cheek to quite enjoy,</div>
<div class="i1">But took no other notice of that little vulgar boy.</div>

<div class="i1">The curses on his ready tongue burst forth as buds in spring;</div>
<div class="i1">His bosom swelled with anger, and he swore like anything!</div>

<div class="i3">Over comfits and cakes,</div>
<div class="i3">And dishes and plates,</div>
<div class="i1">Cowl and cope, and rochet and pall,</div>
<div class="i1">Mitre and crosier! he hopp’d upon all!</div>
<div class="i3">With saucy air,</div>
<div class="i3">He perch’d on the chair</div>
<div class="i3">Where, in state, the great Lord Cardinal sat</div>
<div class="i1">In the great Lord Cardinal’s great red hat;</div>
<div class="i3">And he peer’d in the face Of his Lordship’s Grace,</div>
<div class="i1">With a satisfied look, as if he would say,</div>
<div class="i1">‘We two are the greatest folks here to-day!’</div>
<div class="i3">And the priests, with awe,</div>
<div class="i3">As such freaks they saw,</div>
<div class="i1">Said, ‘The Devil must be in that little Jackdaw!’</div>
<a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><span class="pageno">298</span>
<div class="i1">The feast was over, the board was clear’d,</div>
<div class="i1">The flawns and the custards had all disappear’d,</div>
<div class="i1">And six little Singing-boys,&mdash;dear little souls!</div>
<div class="i1">In nice clean faces, and nice white stoles,</div>
<div class="i3">Came, in order due,</div>
<div class="i3">Two by two,</div>
<div class="i1">Marching that grand refectory through!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A nice little boy held a golden ewer,</div>
<div class="i1">Emboss’d and fill’d with water, as pure</div>
<div class="i1">As any that flows between Rheims and Namur,</div>
<div class="i1">Which a nice little boy stood ready to catch</div>
<div class="i1">In a fine golden hand-basin made to match.</div>
<div class="i1">Two nice little boys, rather more grown,</div>
<div class="i1">Carried lavender-water, and eau de Cologne;</div>
<div class="i1">And a nice little boy had a nice cake of soap,</div>
<div class="i1">Worthy of washing the hands of the Pope.</div>
<div class="i3">One little boy more</div>
<div class="i3">A napkin bore,</div>
<div class="i1">Of the best white diaper, fringed with pink,</div>
<div class="i1">And a Cardinal’s Hat mark’d in ‘permanent ink.’</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The great Lord Cardinal turns at the sight</div>
<div class="i1">Of these nice little boys dress’d all in white:</div>
<div class="i3">From his finger he draws</div>
<div class="i3">His costly turquoise;</div>
<div class="i1">And, not thinking at all about little Jackdaws,</div>
<div class="i3">Deposits it straight</div>
<div class="i3">By the side of his plate,</div>
<div class="i1">While the nice little boys on his Eminence wait;</div>
<div class="i1">Till, when nobody’s dreaming of any such thing,</div>
<div class="i1">That little Jackdaw hops off with the ring!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">There’s a cry and a shout,</div>
<div class="i3">And a deuce of a rout,</div>
<div class="i1">And nobody seems to know what they’re about,</div>
<div class="i1">But the monks have their pockets all turn’d inside out;</div>
<div class="i3">The friars are kneeling,</div>
<div class="i3">And hunting, and feeling</div>
<div class="i1">The carpet, the floor, and the walls, and the ceiling.</div>
<div class="i3">The Cardinal drew</div>
<div class="i3">Off each plum-colour’d shoe,</div>
<div class="i1">And left his red stockings exposed to the view;</div>
<div class="i3">He peeps, and he feels,</div>
<div class="i3">In the toes and the heels;</div>
<div class="i1">They turn up the dishes,&mdash;they turn up the plates,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">They take up the poker and poke out the grates,</div>
<div class="i3">&mdash;They turn up the rugs,</div>
<div class="i3">They examine the mugs:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">But, no!&mdash;no such thing;&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">They can’t find <span class="sc lowercase">THE RING</span>!</div>
<div class="i1">And the Abbot declared that, ‘when nobody twigg’d it,</div>
<div class="i1">Some rascal or other had popp’d in, and prigg’d it!’</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The Cardinal rose with a dignified look,</div>
<div class="i1">He call’d for his candle, his bell, and his book!</div>
<div class="i2">In holy anger, and pious grief,</div>
<div class="i2">He solemnly cursed that rascally thief!</div>
<div class="i2">He cursed him at board, he cursed him in bed;</div>
<div class="i2">From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head;</div>
<div class="i2">He cursed him in sleeping, that every night</div>
<div class="i2">He should dream of the devil, and wake in a fright;</div>
<div class="i2">He cursed him in eating, he cursed him in drinking,</div>
<div class="i2">He cursed him in coughing, in sneezing, in winking;</div>
<div class="i2">He cursed him in sitting, in standing, in lying;</div>
<div class="i2">He cursed him in walking, in riding, in flying,</div>
<div class="i2">He cursed him in living, he cursed him in dying!&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Never was heard such a terrible curse!</div>
<div class="i3">But what gave rise</div>
<div class="i3">To no little surprise,</div>
<div class="i1">Nobody seem’d one penny the worse!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">The day was gone,</div>
<div class="i3">The night came on,</div>
<div class="i1">The Monks and the Friars they search’d till dawn:</div>
<div class="i3">When the Sacristan saw,</div>
<div class="i3">On crumpled claw,</div>
<div class="i1">Come limping a-poor little lame Jackdaw;</div>
<div class="i3">No longer gay,</div>
<div class="i3">As on yesterday;</div>
<div class="i1">His feathers all seem’d to be turn’d the wrong way;&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">His pinions droop’d&mdash;he could hardly stand,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">His head was as bald as the palm of your hand;</div>
<div class="i3">His eye so dim,</div>
<div class="i3">So wasted each limb,</div>
<div class="i1">That, heedless of grammar, they all cried, ‘<span class="sc">That’s him!</span>&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">That’s the scamp that has done this scandalous thing!</div>
<div class="i1">That’s the thief that has got my Lord Cardinal’s Ring!’</div>
<div class="i3">The poor little Jackdaw,</div>
<div class="i3">When the monks he saw,</div>
<div class="i1">Feebly gave vent to the ghost of a caw;</div>
<div class="i1">And turn’d his bald head, as much as to say,</div>
<div class="i1">‘Pray, be so good as to walk this way!’</div>
<div class="i2">Slower and slower, He limp’d on before,</div>
<div class="i1">’Till they came to the back of the belfry door,</div>
<div class="i3">Where the first thing they saw,</div>
<div class="i3">Midst the sticks and the straw,</div>
<div class="i1">Was the <span class="sc lowercase">RING</span> in the nest of that little Jackdaw!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then the great Lord Cardinal call’d for his book,</div>
<div class="i1">And off that terrible curse he took;</div>
<div class="i3">The mute expression</div>
<div class="i3">Served in lieu of confession,</div>
<div class="i1">And, being thus coupled with full restitution,</div>
<div class="i1">The Jackdaw got plenary absolution!</div>
<div class="i3">&mdash;When those words were heard,</div>
<div class="i3">That poor little bird</div>
<div class="i1">Was so changed in a moment, ’twas  really absurd.</div>
<div class="i3">He grew sleek, and fat; In addition to that,</div>
<div class="i1">A fresh crop of feathers came thick as a mat!</div>
<div class="i3">His tail waggled more</div>
<div class="i3">Even than before;</div>
<div class="i1">But no longer it wagged with an impudent air,</div>
<div class="i1">No longer he perch’d on the Cardinal’s chair.</div>
<div class="i3">He hopp’d now about</div>
<div class="i3">With a gait devout;</div>
<div class="i1">At Matins, at Vespers, he never was out;</div>
<div class="i1">And, so far from any more pilfering deeds,</div>
<div class="i1">He always seem’d telling the Confessor’s beads.</div>
<div class="i1">If any one lied,&mdash;or if any one swore,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Or slumber’d in prayer-time, and happen’d to snore,</div>
<div class="i3">That good Jackdaw</div>
<div class="i3">Would give a great ‘Caw,’</div>
<div class="i1">As much as to say, ‘Don’t do so any more!’</div>
<div class="i1">While many remark’d, as his manners they saw,</div>
<div class="i1">That they ‘never had known such a pious Jackdaw!’</div>
<div class="i3">He long lived the pride</div>
<div class="i3">Of that country side,</div>
<div class="i1">And at last in the odour of sanctity died;</div>
<div class="i3">When, as words were too faint,</div>
<div class="i3">His merits to paint,</div>
<div class="i1">The Conclave determined to make him a Saint!</div>
<div class="i1">And on newly-made Saints and Popes, as you know,</div>
<div class="i1">It’s the custom, at Rome, new names to bestow,</div>
<div class="i1">So they canonised him by the name of Jim Crow!</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The Story of the Latest Curse</span></div>
<div class="i1">The Pontiff sat in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s Chair,</div>
<div class="i1">Cardinals, too, quite a host, were there,</div>
<div class="i1">Cardinal this and Cardinal that,</div>
<div class="i1">Cardinals lean and Cardinals fat,</div>
<div class="i1">Cardinals sitting in style and state,</div>
<div class="i1">Cardinals full of importance great,</div>
<div class="i1">With Cardinal Vicars of high degree,</div>
<div class="i1">In sooth, a goodly company;</div>
<div class="i1">And as they sat in full conclave thus</div>
<div class="i1">Momentous matters did they discuss;</div>
<div class="i1">And presented reports of a wide-spread scope</div>
<div class="i1">To their Holy Father and Sovereign Pope.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And chief of points to attention claim</div>
<div class="i1">The perennial Irish Question came,</div>
<div class="i1">With its <em>pros</em> and <em>cons</em>, which no ending knew,</div>
<div class="i1">And the Tory Government’s biassed view.</div>
<a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a><span class="pageno">299</span>
<div class="i1">And the Duke of Norfolk’s suggestions, too,</div>
<div class="i1">Of the course the Pope should henceforth pursue.</div>
<div class="i3">They quoted once more</div>
<div class="i3">All the legal lore</div>
<div class="i1">That, as they said, on the question bore.</div>
<div class="i3">They wrangled, too,</div>
<div class="i3">(Which was nothing new)</div>
<div class="i1">And made a fuss and a great to-do;</div>
<div class="i1">And argued, some for the twentieth time,</div>
<div class="i1">That to join in the “Plan” was a heinous crime,</div>
<div class="i1">And loudly declared, through thick and thin,</div>
<div class="i1">That “Boycotting” was a deadly sin;</div>
<div class="i3">Whilst others maintained</div>
<div class="i3">That no course remained</div>
<div class="i1">Save that to patriots gagged and chained!</div>
<div class="i3">But the Pope meanwhile</div>
<div class="i3">Gave a ghastly smile</div>
<div class="i1">As the Cardinals talked about Erin’s isle,</div>
<div class="i1">And exclaimed, “This matter must settled be,</div>
<div class="i1">Or else it will be the death of me!</div>
<div class="i1">Draw up a report without delay,</div>
<div class="i1">And present it to me this very day;</div>
<div class="i3">For I’ve promised the Duke</div>
<div class="i3">That I’ll rebuke</div>
<div class="i1">My Irish flock in a pastoral way!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">So the Cardinals did what the Pope demanded</div>
<div class="i1">And their Report to him duly handed,</div>
<div class="i1">Denouncing the “Plan” and those who used it,</div>
<div class="i1">And any Priest who at all excused it;</div>
<div class="i1">Condemning “Boycotting,” too, as wrong,</div>
<div class="i1">In Latin phrases extremely strong.</div>
<div class="i1">And having read it, the Pope made known</div>
<div class="i1">That its sentiments were, in good sooth, his own;</div>
<div class="i3">And heedless quite</div>
<div class="i3">Of the cause of right,</div>
<div class="i1">And grossly misled by party spite,</div>
<div class="i1">’Till he was moved to believe the worst</div>
<div class="i1">Of Ireland&mdash;libelled, maligned, aspersed&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">The Pontiff published that famed “Decree,”</div>
<div class="i1">And filled the Unionist camp with glee.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Yes, it filled the Unionists’ hearts with hope,</div>
<div class="i1">For “Lo!” said they, “that obliging Pope</div>
<div class="i1">Has cursed with bell and with book and candle</div>
<div class="i1">The cause of Home Rule&mdash;that crying scandal!</div>
<div class="i1">In holy anger and pious grief</div>
<div class="i1">He’s solemnly cursed each Irish thief!</div>
<div class="i1">He has cursed Parnell and his plundering crew</div>
<div class="i1">In all they say or attempt to do.</div>
<div class="i1">He has cursed the League, he has cursed its chiefs,</div>
<div class="i1">And its helpless serfs, and its threatened fiefs.</div>
<div class="i1">He has cursed O’Brien and Dillon, John,</div>
<div class="i1">And his curse is O’Connor (Tay Pay) upon.</div>
<div class="i1">He has cursed McCarthy and T. M. Healy,</div>
<div class="i1">And all of the Irish leaders, really;</div>
<div class="i1">He’s cursed them abroad, and he’s cursed them at home,</div>
<div class="i1">With all the anathemas used at Rome;</div>
<div class="i1">He’s cursed them both in and out of gaol,</div>
<div class="i1">He’s cursed the few now at large on bail;</div>
<div class="i1">He’s cursed them in eating, he’s cursed them in drinking,</div>
<div class="i1">He’s cursed them in coughing, in sneezing, in winking;</div>
<div class="i1">From the souls of their feet to the crowns of their heads,</div>
<div class="i1">He’s cursed them awake, and asleep in their beds;</div>
<div class="i1">He’s cursed them in standing, in sitting, in lying,</div>
<div class="i1">He’s cursed them in speaking, and selling, and buying;</div>
<div class="i1">He’s cursed the Gladstonian Party, too,</div>
<div class="i1">For daring to make that alliance new.</div>
<div class="i1">In short these Unionists all averred</div>
<div class="i1">So dreadful a curse had never been heard!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Forsooth these Unionists talked away,</div>
<div class="i1">Of this Papal curse all the live-long-day,</div>
<div class="i1">And gloated with quite a savage glee</div>
<div class="i1">On what must come of the Pope’s “Decree.”</div>
<div class="i1">“They must be crushed, these vile Irishmen,”</div>
<div class="i1">They daily repeated with tongue and pen.</div>
<div class="i1">“No more shall we hear of Parnell’s fresh crimes!”</div>
<div class="i1">Exclaimed, in “leaded bourgeois,” the <cite>Times</cite>,</div>
<div class="i1">“Confusion has stricken the League’s curs’d host,”</div>
<div class="i1">Was the warning cry of the jubilant <cite>Post</cite>.</div>
<div class="i1">“There’s an end forthwith to the sorry set!”</div>
<div class="i1">Was the evening shriek of <cite><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s Gazette</cite>.</div>
<div class="i1">But all the time they were writing thus,</div>
<div class="i1">And making this daily fame and fuss,</div>
<div class="i1">Declaring the Nationalist cause was done,</div>
<div class="i1">And the Parnellites doomed were every one.</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst still they were bidding the world to see</div>
<div class="i1">What ruin was wrought by the Pope’s “Decree,”</div>
<div class="i1">And everywhere stating, in prose and verse,</div>
<div class="i1">There never was heard such a terrible curse!</div>
<div class="i3">This fact gave rise</div>
<div class="i3">To no little surprise,</div>
<div class="i1"><em>Nobody seem’d one penny the worse!</em></div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">Stay! some one <em>seems</em> a good deal the worse</div>
<div class="i1">For this much-debated Vatican curse;</div>
<div class="i1">And that is the Pope himself, for he,</div>
<div class="i1">By even the issue of his “Decree,”</div>
<div class="i1">Made public the fact, beyond recall,</div>
<div class="i1">That he knows of Ireland nothing at all.</div>
<div class="i1">The Irish Bishops ’tis true, have tried,</div>
<div class="i1">To soften the blow to their Pontiff’s pride;</div>
<div class="i1">While the Irish people have treated his curse</div>
<div class="i1">As a Papal weakness, and nothing worse.</div>
<div class="i3">So far, so good!</div>
<div class="i3">But the Pontiff should</div>
<div class="i1">Bear in mind in how false a place he’s stood;</div>
<div class="i1">He must ne’er again base denunciation</div>
<div class="i1">On false and on biassed information;</div>
<div class="i1">And certainly never give vent to a curse</div>
<div class="i1">For which <em>he</em> only is any the worse!</div>

<div class="i1">Old Boreas sprung up one day&mdash;says he,</div>

<div class="i1">I must be very much missed, no doubt,</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis a long time since I had a <em>blow out</em>;</div>
<div class="i1">And as things in town are dreadfully dead,</div>

<div class="i1">Yes, now for a rollicksome, frolicksome chase,</div>
<div class="i1"><em>I’ll raise the wind</em> in every place.”</div>
<div class="i1">So away he went, through the Strand so gay,</div>
<div class="i1"><em>Blowing up</em> everything in his way&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Upsetting dozens (in spite of their squalls,)</div>
<div class="i1">Of old women’s apple and lollipop stalls.</div>

<div class="i1">On went Boreas playing his rigs,</div>
<div class="i1">Blowing off bonnets and ladies’ wigs&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Making their hairless heads apparent,</div>
<div class="i1">Which none would do but a rogue so arrant.</div>
<div class="i1">Puffing and blowing onwards he bounds,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">On went Boreas, mighty and strong,</div>
<div class="i1">Puffing out lamps as he went along&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Patting a thief in the way of a job,</div>
<div class="i1">Of <em>dissecting</em> a pocket, or lightening a fob:</div>
<div class="i1">Leaving the Peelers quite in the dark,</div>
<div class="i1">Doing a turn for an amorous spark;</div>

<div class="i1">Upon the Park he flies to attend,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Down he rushed to the river side,</div>

<div class="i1">Gave Father Thames some <em>blows in the face</em>.</div>

<div class="i1">At last his frolics came to an end,</div>

<div class="i1">Blew himself to <em>Wind</em>&mdash;sor to spend the night.</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">A Parliamentary Legend.</span></div>
<div class="i1">The Marquis Bobby sat down one day,</div>
<div class="i1">Feeling himself in a very bad way:</div>
<div class="i1">His was the delicate porcelain clay</div>
<div class="i3">Not made for <em>the shelf</em>, like mere common delf,</div>
<div class="i3">And he felt that the world wanted something&mdash;himself;</div>
<div class="i1">For he loved to stand in the light of day,</div>
<div class="i1">To have his own way, and to say his own say&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">To slaughter and gibbet and mangle.</div>
<div class="i1">Now he thought to himself, here’s the devil to pay,</div>
<div class="i3">Never a chance of a row or a wrangle,</div>
<div class="i3">No Afghan affairs to get in a tangle.</div>
<div class="i1">Gladstone before and old Johnny behind;</div>
<div class="i1">With a wide-awake Postmaster, even if blind;</div>
<div class="i3">Everything bound to go to the bad:</div>
<div class="i1"><em>His place</em>, too, filled by a rascally “Rad.”</div>
<div class="i1">Things seemed to his lordship gloomy&mdash;very,</div>
<div class="i1">So he rose and rang for his Secretary.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">Mr. Sec.&mdash;was a gentleman born</div>
<div class="i3">Who hated a “Cad” with a noble scorn:</div>
<div class="i1">He had learned at the best of public schools,</div>
<div class="i1">To sneer at snobs, and the wretched fools,</div>
<div class="i1">Who earned bread and cheese upon office stools,</div>
<div class="i1">And his clothes were got on credit from Poole’s;</div>
<div class="i1">He knew men were fools who trusted <em>two</em> stools,</div>
<div class="i1">So wisely followed <em>her Ladyship’s</em> rules.</div>
<div class="i3">He entered in haste, tho’ with dignified gait</div>
<div class="i3">(It <em>wasn’t allowed</em> for Lord Bobby to wait).</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The noble Marquis raised his head,</div>
<div class="i1">And to his underling he said:</div>
<div class="i3">“Beaconsfield’s dead, and Northcote is led</div>
<div class="i3">By the nose, and whatever the last man has said,</div>
<div class="i1">Richmond’s a donkey; Cairns is a parson;</div>
<div class="i1">Who but myself can carry this farce on?</div>
<div class="i1">People agree that there must be a head;</div>
<div class="i1">And there’s only myself in the old man’s stead;</div>
<div class="i3">Tell me, Sir Secretary, what think you,</div>
<div class="i3">What can a born statesman find to do?”</div>
<div class="i1">He paused, and the gentleman scratched his head,</div>
<div class="i1">“There’s only the Land Bill, my lord,” he said,</div>
<div class="i1">And the news of the evening, as you will see,</div>
<div class="i1">Is that the Commons will not agree.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a><span class="pageno">301</span>
<div class="i1">Then the Marquis Bobby jumped up in haste,</div>
<div class="i1">And he muttered a something that sounded like “baste.”</div>
<div class="i3">And something resembling “bate ’em;”</div>
<div class="i1">He felt that the fun wasn’t yet quite done,</div>
<div class="i3">Though he’d issued his “ultimatum.”</div>
<div class="i1">“Enough&mdash;call it done, my son of a gun&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">I’ll show ’em a game ere with me they’ve done:</div>
<div class="i3">Go call my henchmen liel and true:</div>
<div class="i3">Call Cranbrook, Carnarvon and ‘canny’ Buccleuch,</div>
<div class="i3">And call that fool of a Marlborough, too,</div>
<div class="i3">Fetch the rest of the noble crew,</div>
<div class="i3">With heads so thick and blood so blue;</div>
<div class="i3">And by way of a ‘rat’ and a tit for a tat,</div>
<div class="i3">Look up the Grey and the Fortescue;</div>
<div class="i3">And even Gladstone shall learn to rue</div>
<div class="i3">That with Irish landlords he’d aught to do;”</div>
<div class="i1">Then his lordship sighed as he thought of the grouse,</div>
<div class="i1">Put on his hat and went down to the “House.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The clock strikes twelve, it is really midnight,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">But “their Lordships’ House” is a blaze of light;</div>
<div class="i1">The parties have met and been pretty hard set,</div>
<div class="i1">To amend the amendments and manage to get</div>
<div class="i1">A Bill which <em>looks</em> something substantial&mdash;and yet</div>
<div class="i1">Isn’t the thing that is wanted quite</div>
<div class="i3">In this nice little island so bright and so tight.</div>
<div class="i1">The Marquis Bobby has had his fling&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Denounced the whole as a villainous thing,</div>
<div class="i1">A theft&mdash;a blunder&mdash;a sham&mdash;and a sin,</div>
<div class="i1">And sworn that the Lords will <em>never give in</em>.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Gad, ’tis a very fine sight to see</div>
<div class="i1">A very fine Aristocracy,</div>
<div class="i3">Proud of port and stern of eye,</div>
<div class="i3">With a look that says plainly&mdash;“Never say die,”</div>
<div class="i3">Stemming the tide of Democracy.</div>
<div class="i3">The clock strikes “one” and the thing isn’t done.</div>
<div class="i3">The Marquis Bobby has munched a bun,</div>
<div class="i3">Some aged nobles have “cut and run;”</div>
<div class="i1">But sternly arrayed, as to say, “Who’s afraid!”</div>
<div class="i1">The rest wait for the message too long delayed.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The clock strikes “four,” and at the door</div>
<div class="i1">Sounds a something that isn’t exactly a roar&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">A sort of a scuffle and underbred shuffle,</div>
<div class="i3">As of Commons who wouldn’t their lordships ruffle;</div>
<div class="i1">Impatience just tempered with awe.</div>
<div class="i3">But the message is plain&mdash;as plain as the day,</div>
<div class="i3">“<cite>My Lords, the Commons will not obey.</cite>”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then the Marquis Bobby in wrath arose,</div>
<div class="i1">And he&mdash;well, I’m almost afraid to disclose;</div>
<div class="i1">Well&mdash;he took up his hat and he blew at his nose,</div>
<div class="i1">And&mdash;did as do Fakirs, or people called Quakers,</div>
<div class="i1">Or a gentleman namesake of his, “Bobby Acres,”</div>
<div class="i3">And exclaimed, “Why, hullo! here’s a rum go.</div>
<div class="i1">That fellow has made us do just what he chose.</div>
<div class="i1">We certainly might have saved all our jaws.</div>
<div class="i1">Thank God,” with a pause, “there’s <em>the wild duck clause</em>;</div>
<div class="i1">But they’ll laugh at and quiz us all over their town,</div>
<div class="i1">We’re all of us done so uncommonly brown.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">What act could be done? Well, it wouldn’t surprise one</div>
<div class="i3">To know that they did a very unwise one,</div>
<div class="i1">But now in their favour, there’s this to be said,</div>
<div class="i1">They thought better of it, and you may have read,</div>
<div class="i1">That my Lords and Lord Bobby&mdash;<em>went home to bed</em>.</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The Devil’s Billiard Match.</span></div>
<div class="i1">Mr. Peeler was known to be one of the milliards</div>
<div class="i1">Who go in for spending their talents on billiards;</div>
<div class="i4">And by diligent training,</div>
<div class="i4">And careful abstaining</div>
<div class="i1">From gin and tobacco, succeeded in gaining</div>
<div class="i1">Such skill at a hazard, a cannon, or “pot,”</div>
<div class="i4">And was voted so “hot”</div>
<div class="i4">When he got “on the spot,”</div>
<div class="i1">That no one would play him, not e’en the great Cooker,</div>
<div class="i1">(Who some people say is a bit of a fluker).</div>
<div class="i1">He gave points to Jobenit, Bobs, and Michelli,</div>
<div class="i1">And knocked the whole lot of ’em into a jelly;</div>
<div class="i4">He often would make</div>
<div class="i4">A two-thousand break,</div>
<div class="i1">And only left off when he found his arm ache,</div>
<div class="i1">Such a wonderful use did he make of his “stick,”</div>
<div class="i1">That everyone thought he was leagued with Old Nick;</div>
<div class="i1">And they went down to see this most wonderful “coon,”</div>
<div class="i4">Evening and noon,</div>
<div class="i4">In December or June,</div>
<div class="i1">At the Royal Aquarium Billiard Saloon.</div>
<div class="i4">And some time ago,</div>
<div class="i4">As perhaps you may know,</div>
<div class="i1">A match was arranged, and this time Peeler’s foe</div>
<div class="i1">Was Signor Michelli, who often made lots</div>
<div class="i4">Of very good shots</div>
<div class="i4">And consecutive “spots,”</div>
<div class="i1">And the odds Peeler gave to this man of such fame</div>
<div class="i1">Were five hundred points in a one thousand game.</div>
<div class="i1">Now Signor Michelli, though very much saner</div>
<div class="i1">Than many, was far from a total abstainer;</div>
<div class="i1">And whether the cheer of the festival season</div>
<a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a><span class="pageno">302</span>
<div class="i1">Or hard mental work had deprived him of reason</div>
<div class="i1">I cannot affirm, but I’m positive quite,</div>
<div class="i4">That he <em>looked</em> to be tight,</div>
<div class="i4">On the advertised night,</div>
<div class="i1">In spite of his tie and his linen so white;</div>
<div class="i1">For when he came in he walked up to the slate,</div>
<div class="i1">And proceeded at once in a manner sedate,</div>
<div class="i1">To rub out the figures just under his name,</div>
<div class="i1">And said that he “Wanted no pointsh in thish game,”</div>
<div class="i4">And would play “the young d&mdash;&mdash;l,”</div>
<div class="i4">A thousand up level;</div>
<div class="i1">After making which modest and courteous remarks,</div>
<div class="i1">He proceeded at once to be up to his larks;</div>
<div class="i4">Made a very bad shot</div>
<div class="i4">To screw in off the spot,</div>
<div class="i1">(Instead of just giving the usual miss)</div>
<div class="i1">Which was baulked by his making the two balls to kiss,</div>
<div class="i4">And left a good cannon</div>
<div class="i4">For Peeler, who ran on</div>
<div class="i1">Ran off, and ran out, and finished the game,</div>
<div class="i1">Amidst a loud cheering and general acclaim;</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst Michelli, who’d wanted to shine as a hero,</div>
<div class="i1">Stared aghast at his chalks, which were standing at zero.</div>
<div class="i1">At this point a gentleman stepped forth from the audience,</div>
<div class="i4">Who’d apparently tried</div>
<div class="i4">All colour to hide,</div>
<div class="i1">And to drive from his raiment all tints that were <em>gaudy</em> hence;</div>
<div class="i4">His clothes were all black,</div>
<div class="i4">At the front and the back,</div>
<div class="i1">His handkerchief, watch-chain, and locket, and tie,</div>
<div class="i1">His shirt and his studs, and his collar so high,</div>
<div class="i1">His boots and his buttons, his hat and his rings&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">In short, every one of his visible things</div>
<div class="i1">Was as black as a crow, and&mdash;keep down your <span class="lock">sniggers&mdash;</span></div>
<div class="i1"><em>His face and his hands were as black as a nigger’s!</em></div>
<div class="i4">He took his hat off</div>
<div class="i4">And uttered a cough;</div>
<div class="i1">Then with cynical satire, and many a scoff,</div>
<div class="i4">He called Mr. Peeler</div>
<div class="i4">A “ginger-pop dealer,”</div>
<div class="i1">And snapped out “Nicolo Scratchini’s my name,</div>
<div class="i1">And I’ll play Mr. Peeler a ten-thousand game;</div>
<div class="i1">And these points I will my opponent assign&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1"><em>Nine thousand nine hundred and ninety and nine!</em></div>
<div class="i1">And the stakes&mdash;&mdash;” here he whispered in Peeler’s left ear,</div>
<div class="i1">And that eminent cueist turned giddy with fear;</div>
<div class="i1">But covered the tip of his cue well with chalk,</div>
<div class="i1">And led off the game with a miss into baulk.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But his sable opponent then smirked a queer smirk,</div>
<div class="i1">And flourished his cue as he’d flourish a dirk,</div>
<div class="i1">Put his ball in the D, and aimed right at the red;</div>
<div class="i1">And with such awful twist on his flying ball sped,</div>
<div class="i1">That it screwed into baulk in the right corner pocket;</div>
<div class="i1">As a ruby gleam flashed from the Stranger’s black locket,</div>
<div class="i1">Then he got “on the spot” and made three thousand hazards;</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst the audience stared as if knocked on the mazzards;</div>
<div class="i1">Then made scores of cannons&mdash;the kind known as “nursery”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst Peeler was making remarks that were curse-ory;</div>
<div class="i1">And at last, being “cushioned” or “under the bank,”</div>
<div class="i4">Fetched his ball such a twank,</div>
<div class="i4">Such a terrible spank,</div>
<div class="i1">That it gave to the red a most thundering clank,</div>
<div class="i4">And both smashed to bits,</div>
<div class="i4">And knocked into fits</div>
<div class="i1">The marker who sat where he commonly sits;</div>
<div class="i1">And the audience yelled, when they saw all this steam on,</div>
<div class="i1">“My! ain’t he a scorcher! O, ain’t he a demon!”</div>
<div class="i1">Then Signor Scratchini, as meek as a lamb,</div>
<div class="i1">Looked up, and most quaintly remarked, “Yes, I am!”</div>
<div class="i1">And his polished black boots turned to black hoofs with corns,</div>
<div class="i1">And his black curly hair to a black pair of horns,</div>
<div class="i1">His cue to a pitchfork, his black eyes to coals,</div>
<div class="i1">His fingers to claws, and his studs into holes</div>
<div class="i1">From whence there came out such a fire and a smoke</div>
<div class="i1">That everyone felt just as though they would choke;</div>
<div class="i1">And he grabbed hold of Peeler, with eyes darting flame,</div>
<div class="i1">But Peeler had presence of mind to exclaim&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“You’ve not won me yet, you old cheat! fie for shame!</div>
<div class="i1">Fair play’s a jewel, Nick! Finish the game.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Nick let go his hold, for though only a curs’t ’un</div>
<div class="i1">He felt he was bound, by the framed rules of Thurston,</div>
<div class="i1">Since he’d broken the balls, to be honest and plain,</div>
<div class="i1">And call upon Peeler to “break them” again.</div>
<div class="i4">So P. in a stew</div>
<div class="i4">Took up his cue</div>
<div class="i1">And aimed at the red in a manner so true,</div>
<div class="i1">And put on his ball such a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quantum</i> of screw,</div>
<div class="i4">That without more ado</div>
<div class="i4">It vanished from view</div>
<div class="i1">In the top corner bag&mdash;and the red went in too.</div>
<div class="i4">Old Scratch gave a scream</div>
<div class="i4">That curdled the cream,</div>
<div class="i1">And was gone from their gaze like a horrible dream,</div>
<div class="i1">(Which is not an original line, by the way,</div>
<div class="i1">Though where I have read it I really can’t say.)</div>
<div class="i4">And then Mr, Peeler</div>
<div class="i4">Called a four-wheeler,</div>
<div class="i1">And drove home at once without any delay,</div>
<div class="i1">And never played billiards again from that day,</div>
<div class="i1">But turned to a rigidly moral and <em>mental</em> man,</div>
<div class="i1">And was troubled no more by the black-dressed Old Gentleman.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><span class="sc">Moral.</span></div>
<div class="i1">Don’t think that a man who’s a total abstainer</div>
<div class="i1">Is therefore as good as a saint&mdash;to be plainer,</div>
<div class="i1">Don’t be sure that a chap who’ll not drink, smoke, or marry</div>
<div class="i1">May not all the same be in league with Old Harry.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">You’ll get much more good from Æneids and Iliads</div>
<div class="i1">Than by wasting your time and your money on billiards,</div>
<div class="i1">For take it as true, be you sage or buffoon,</div>
<div class="i1">You are sure to find Nick in a billiard saloon.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">One word more,</div>
<div class="i4">If a score</div>
<div class="i4">Will make the game o’er,</div>
<div class="i1">Just “shop” your opponent, and bolt through the door.</div>

<p><cite>Mirth and Metre</cite>, by Frank E. Smedley and Edmund H.
Yates, published by G. Routledge &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, 1855, was a small
shilling book of poetry, written avowedly in imitation of
Barham’s <cite>Ingoldsby Legends</cite>, besides containing several
excellent parodies of other authors.</p>

<p>The following extracts from one of the imitations, written

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Cardinal’s Hat.</span></p>

<p>A tremendous outcry against the Roman Catholics was
raised in 1850, when the Pope created Cardinal Nicholas
Wiseman&mdash;Archbishop of Westminster, and divided all
England into Romish dioceses. But the agitation ended in
smoke, it is true the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill was passed in
1851, yet it has practically remained a dead letter, and it
was wittily said of Lord John Russell that, after chalking
up “No Popery” on Cardinal Wiseman’s door, and
ringing the bell&mdash;he ran away.</p>

<p>Amongst the many pamphlets written on the topic was
one published by Henry Beal, Shoe Lane, London, entitled
“<cite>The Cardinal’s Hat</cite>: How, when, and where it was made,
and what became of it.” By Ipsedixit. 1851. This is an
imitation of the Ingoldsby Legends, and like them is very
uncomplimentary to Roman Catholic priests, consequently,
several passages have been omitted in the following reprint,
as being not only offensive and ungenerous, but also
untrue:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">We have all of us heard of the <span class="sc">City of Rome</span>,</div>
<div class="i2">The fountain of Catholic blessings, and curses,</div>
<div class="i2">Where those who are lucky in having long purses</div>
<div class="i1">Go, to stare at the huge Coliseum and Dome</div>
<div class="i1">Of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s, and bring curiosities home,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Such as medals, and casts; and indeed, whate’er fixes</div>
<div class="i1">Their fancies,&mdash;rags&mdash;relics&mdash;beads&mdash;bones&mdash;crucifixes;</div>
<div class="i1">Grand portraits of Saints, who cured fearful disease</div>
<div class="i1">By the sufferer’s merely going down on his knees,</div>
<div class="i1">And telling some beads, and by offering some fees,</div>
<div class="i1">For Saints, like the men who take M.D. degrees,</div>
<div class="i1">Their practice conduct in an orthodox way,</div>
<div class="i1">And grant no relief to the souls who can’t pay.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Well&mdash;in this great and world-renowned City of Rome,</div>
<div class="i1">Within the broad shadow that’s cast by the dome</div>
<div class="i1">Of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s aforesaid, is the Strada del Popolo,</div>
<div class="i1">In which stands the house of the famed <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jacopolo;</div>
<div class="i1">And there reside thirty or forty stout monks, to see</div>
<div class="i1">Whom, much reminds one of Smithfield obesity.</div>
<div class="i6">All day long</div>
<div class="i6">Goes ding-dong</div>
<div class="i4">Their bells&mdash;and their song</div>
<div class="i1">Alarms you at eve as you’re walking along:</div>
<div class="i1">But at midnight, a wild and demoniac yelling</div>
<div class="i1">Is heard from within, of some mystery telling;</div>
<div class="i6">And I’ve heard</div>
<div class="i6">It averred,</div>
<div class="i4">That a vile brimstone smell in</div>
<div class="i1">The Strada del Popolo, oft causes those</div>
<div class="i1">Who’re passing&mdash;the orifice nasal to close;</div>
<div class="i1">And, like old Daniel Tucker, of whom, I dare say</div>
<div class="i1">You have heard&mdash;to make tracks “and git out of the way.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now&mdash;scorning the aid of that personage odious,</div>
<div class="i1">The two-sticked dark gentleman known as <cite>Asmodeus</cite>;</div>
<div class="i1">We have unroofed the house of these portly old men,</div>
<div class="i1">And gaze without obstacle into their den!</div>
<div class="i1"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s great bell tells one more day is dead;</div>
<div class="i1">Respectable persons lie snugly in bed;</div>
<div class="i1">Only a beggar or woman with shrewd eye,</div>
<div class="i1">Is prowling about, to pick up a few <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">scudi</i>;</div>
<div class="i1">But Jacopolo’s altar is all in a blaze,</div>
<div class="i1">Ten thousand wax tapers emit their bright rays,</div>
<div class="i1">And at first you are almost struck blind as you gaze:</div>
<div class="i1">The Abbot is clad in his finest attire</div>
<div class="i1">Of satin and silk, at a price rather higher</div>
<div class="i1">Than an <em>un</em>-worldly man, one might think, would desire;</div>
<div class="i1">But what puzzled one most&mdash;and what seemed very queer,</div>
<div class="i1">Was&mdash;that all the fat Monks of Jacopolo there,</div>
<div class="i1">Instead of performing prescribed genuflexions,</div>
<div class="i1">Or praying to Saints, to forgive their defections:</div>
<div class="i1">Or joining (melodious old souls!) in the quire,</div>
<div class="i1">All stood in a circle around a huge fire,</div>
<div class="i1">Over which was a vessel of brass&mdash;yes, ’twas  <em>that</em> metal,</div>
<div class="i1">And in heretic lands ’twould be known as a <span class="sc">Hat-Kettle</span>:</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">What are they doing?</div>
<div class="i4">Some mischief is brewing!</div>
<div class="i1">In the cauldron like that one in <cite>Macbeth</cite>, is stewing</div>
<div class="i1">Something I warrant for somebody’s ruin!</div>
<div class="i1">See how the burly monks plunge, each a fist</div>
<div class="i1">Into the kettle, from which goes a mist</div>
<div class="i1">Creeping and curling like snakes to the ceiling:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">For something right down at its bottom they’re feeling;</div>
<div class="i1">Now they have got it, and like Monks of mettle</div>
<div class="i1">They dab a wet mass on the rim of the kettle.</div>
<div class="i1">Shapeless and dark is it!&mdash;but with a shout</div>
<div class="i1">The Monks of Jacopolo maul it about;</div>
<div class="i1">Bow to it&mdash;pray to it;&mdash;each one caresses it,</div>
<div class="i1">E’en the Abbot himself lays his hand on, and blesses it:</div>
<a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a><span class="pageno">305</span>
<div class="i4">They roll it, and wrinkle,</div>
<div class="i4">Punch it, and sprinkle:</div>
<div class="i4">A silver bell’s tinkle</div>
<div class="i1">Is heard&mdash;then the Abbot proceeds to un-padlock</div>
<div class="i1">A casket, and from it with prayers takes a hat-block.</div>
<div class="i1">[The last rhyme, dear reader, I very well know</div>
<div class="i1">Just as well as yourself, is not quite <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme il faut</i>,</div>
<div class="i1">But I’d rather make such a slight slip, than I’d fit a lie</div>
<div class="i1">For the sake of mere <em>sound</em> to this true tale of Italy.]</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">Yes, the Abbot devout,</div>
<div class="i4">A <span class="sc">Hat Block</span> took out,</div>
<div class="i1">And ’twas  hailed by the Monks with a song and a shout:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Not a block of the shape of a hat worn in town;</div>
<div class="i1">But much like a wide-a-wake’s&mdash;low in the crown,</div>
<div class="i1">Only not shaped like those of drab, white, green or brown,</div>
<div class="i1">But level as rail-road&mdash;in short, ’twas  a flat</div>
<div class="i1">Block, such as is used for a milling cove’s hat.</div>
<div class="i1">Mr. Bendigo wears such a one&mdash;think of that,</div>
<div class="i1">And without further parley you have the thing pat.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Hail Mary!” the Abbot cried&mdash;“Look upon that</div>
<div class="i1">I ne’er saw a handsomer <span class="sc">Cardinal’s Hat</span>!</div>
<div class="i1">In England, I fancy&mdash;’twill rather surprise Man,</div>
<div class="i1">Woman, and Child, when ’tis worn by <span class="sc">Nick Wiseman</span>.”</div>
<div class="i1">(And really, to give the old Abbot his due</div>
<div class="i1">The latter remark was undoubtedly true;)</div>
<div class="i1">“And,” he added, “Proceed, your good work and divine in,</div>
<div class="i1">As now ’tis our duty to put in the lining.”</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Yes, the Cardinal’s Hat was completed at last,</div>
<div class="i1">And <span class="sc">Nicholas Wiseman</span> went rather <em>too</em> fast,</div>
<div class="i1"><span class="sc">To Rome</span> where that feeble old Potentate <span class="sc">Pius</span>,</div>
<div class="i1">Who, it seems, a fresh chance for our souls, won’t deny us,</div>
<div class="i1">Plac’d the hat on his cunning old pate, and said “Rise Man,</div>
<div class="i1"><span class="sc">Archbishop of Westminster&mdash;Cardinal Wiseman!</span>”</div>
<div class="i1">And his newly-made Eminence rose from his knees</div>
<div class="i1">As proud and designing a Priest as you please!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But a very short time had passed by, and the <span class="sc">Hat</span></div>
<div class="i1">Was dingy and shabby, and crushed almost flat:</div>
<div class="i1">For on it, John Bull, set his sturdy old heel,</div>
<div class="i1">Saying&mdash;“Pius, my Bishoprics <em>you</em> shall not steal;”</div>
<div class="i1">And to Wiseman&mdash;“Old Craftyman&mdash;vanish from here&mdash;”</div>
<div class="i1">And he went with a Protestant flea in his ear!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">But the <span class="sc">Cardinal’s Hat</span>!</div>
<div class="i4">How fared it with that?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Why from Westminster it was sent into <span class="sc">Rag Fair</span>!</div>
<div class="i1">But the Jews wouldn’t have the vile article there,</div>
<div class="i1">And the last time ’twas  seen, it was kicked with disdain</div>

<div class="i1">The good <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gladstone sat on his stool,</div>
<div class="i2">A-reading a big black book,</div>
<div class="i1">With a steadfast patience, as was his rule,</div>
<div class="i1">For <em>he</em> never frivolled or played the fool,</div>
<div class="i1">Like a wanton urchin a-weary of school;</div>
<div class="i1">But, though ’twas  the rollicking season of Yule,</div>
<div class="i1">He studied in quiet, and kept himself cool,</div>
<div class="i1">On his stool of repentance&mdash;a hard-bottomed stool&mdash;</div>
<div class="i4">And ne’er from that sage</div>
<div class="i4">Constitutional page</div>
<div class="i3">His reverent gaze he took.</div>
<div class="i1">“We will woo,” cried Old Nick, “good <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gladstone’s eyes</div>

<div class="i1">From it they did not sink or rise,</div>

<div class="i2">Could win away his look.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">One black imp came in a masquerade</div>
<div class="i2">Most like a ghoul’s attire,</div>
<div class="i1">With a face like a skull in dried parchment arrayed,</div>

Ingoldsby versification. On May 4, 1888, he

<p>From <cite>The Jingoldsby Legends</cite>. By Jonas Jingoldsby,
Esquire. Published at 84, Fleet Street, London, about
1882.</p>

<p>After many years of discussion, it was decided to remove
Temple Bar, principally because it interfered with the
traffic, but the City authorities, egged on by a nobody who
shall be nameless, decided to erect a monument in its
place. Hence the hideous Griffin obstruction which it was
said cost London £12,000; it was so detested and ridiculed
that for a long time after its erection two constables had
to guard it night and day, or it would probably have been
demolished. As it was, great damage was done to it on
several occasions, but it still stands, a costly monument of
toadyism, folly, and bad taste.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pigeon Shooting at Hurlingham.</span></p>

<p>In this Sport every element of manly courage and skill is
brought into play. The poor caged birds are generally so
bewildered on being released that they can scarcely fly, and
the skilled marksmen often wound them, so that they flutter
about for hours with broken legs and wings. This affords
excellent entertainment to the tender-hearted ladies of
fashion who witness the sports, and bet on the results.</p>

<p>Occasionally a bird is killed at once, others escape from
the grounds and are either captured, or tortured to death by
that respectable class of the community which usually congregates
around fairs, race meetings, and prize fights.</p>

<p>Altogether, Pigeon-shooting is <em>the</em> sport which, for the
sake of our National reputation, should be encouraged.</p>

<p>When we have persuaded the Spaniards to abolish their
Bull fights as cruel and unmanly, we may bring them to the
innocent delights of battue shooting, hare coursing, fox
hunting, or even to Pigeon Shooting, and so realise Poet
Wordsworth’s noble ideal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="i2">Well, here I am, and precious hot I find it,</div>
<div class="i1">I wish I were a Fantail not to mind it;</div>
<div class="i1">Ten to the foot’s too warm for any sinner,</div>
<div class="i1">I’d quite as soon be in a pie for dinner;</div>
<div class="i1">In fact, it would be cooler to be bakèd,</div>

<div class="i1">And leave our feet outside; but here, I tell ye,</div>
<div class="i1">My toes are cramped and trodden to a jelly.</div>

<div class="i1">The fell destroyer of our harmless race,</div>
<div class="i1">Centre of fashion, haunt of lords and ladies,</div>
<div class="i1">A whited sepulchre, a dazzling Hades.</div>
<div class="i1">From Monday here we’re massacred till Saturday,</div>

<div class="i1">With jealous hearts, intent to shed the blood</div>
<div class="i1">Which, like their own, dates backwards to the Flood,</div>
<div class="i1">As for a pretext, they can find a reason</div>
<div class="i1">For killing us each day throughout the season.</div>
<div class="i1">Some people talk as if the sport were quite meant</div>
<div class="i1">To give the birds some innocent amusement,</div>
<div class="i1">And say a little shooting to us Rocks is</div>
<div class="i1">Just the delight that hunting is to foxes.</div>
<div class="i1">Poor beasts! How can they possibly avoid it?</div>
<div class="i1">They’d “be surprised to hear” how they enjoyed it.</div>
<div class="i2">One says that killing pigeons is as good</div>
<div class="i1">As murdering barn-door pheasants in a wood.</div>
<div class="i1">Granted. But please to prove that shooting’s pleasant</div>
<div class="i1">When looked at from the aspect of the pheasant.</div>
<div class="i2">They all insist that death attends the shot,</div>
<div class="i1">(Some think precedes a trifle and some not);</div>
<div class="i1">And then they cry, in ecstasies of virtue,</div>
<div class="i1">“Poor things! we kill you, but we never hurt you.”</div>
<div class="i2">Who was it made the theory so astutely</div>
<div class="i1">That pigeons cannot feel at all acutely?</div>
<div class="i1">Well, of a want of feeling when he spoke, we</div>

<div class="i1">Another shoots, but votes the betting snobbish.</div>
<div class="i1">This little episode a moral teaches;</div>
<div class="i1">Which of the two is right? I fancy each is.</div>
<div class="i2">If we are only slaughter for the larder,</div>
<div class="i1">I wish they’d miss us clean or hit us harder.</div>
<div class="i1">This amateur despatching ten times worse is</div>
<div class="i1">Even than the wicked poulterer’s tender mercies;</div>
<div class="i1">And why should man be justified in maiming us,</div>
<div class="i1">Because he had the privilege of naming us?</div>
<div class="i2">“You ladies! You whose gentle hearts do fear</div>
<div class="i1">The smallest monstrous mouse,” what make you here?</div>

<div class="i1">And cry “He’s safe, poor darling! How delightful!”</div>
<div class="i1">So young, so fair, and can ye lack compassion?</div>
<div class="i1">It cannot be; ye are but slaves to Fashion,</div>
<div class="i1">Bowing yourselves, as did the Jewish nation,</div>

<div class="i1">Alas! the middle trap he lays his hand on,</div>
<div class="i1">“Ye (birds) who enter here all hope abandon.”</div>
<div class="i1">And now he’s pulled my tail out by the roots,</div>
<div class="i1">I feel as helpless as a Puss-in-Boots.</div>
<div class="i1">(Ah! our poor tails, they won’t believe we need ’em</div>
<div class="i1">Or else they’re fitting us for <em>endless</em> freedom.)</div>
<div class="i1">They say it’s to prevent my being hit.</div>
<div class="i1">(It’s very good of them to mention it.)</div>
<div class="i1">They tell me I’m a clipper! and shall wobble,</div>
<div class="i1">“And yet I am not happy” for their trouble;</div>
<div class="i1">And if they want me to get safe from harms off,</div>
<div class="i1">Why don’t they pull the sportsman’s legs and arms off?</div>
<div class="i2">Fast in the middle trap. To test the cunning</div>
<div class="i1">Of the great guns, it’s fallen nine times running;</div>
<div class="i1">And now, to baffle their unerring aim,</div>
<div class="i1">The next that falls is sure to be the same.</div>
<div class="i1">A chilly fear of death is stealing o’er me,</div>
<div class="i1">And all my <em>peck</em>adilloes flash before me.</div>
<a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a><span class="pageno">310</span>
<div class="i1">It’s very sad to die&mdash;to die&mdash;to sleep&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">To sleep, perchance to dream; I’ll take a peep&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Oh! that fair grove, and yon delicious pine,</div>
<div class="i1">Towering beyond the fatal boundary line.</div>
<div class="i1">And there he stands, the fatal swell of Hurlingham:</div>
<div class="i1">His little black moustaches, how he’s twirling ’em,’</div>
<div class="i1">Here comes his gun! If he forgets to cock it,</div>
<div class="i1">I’m off to Alabama like a rocket.</div>
<div class="i1">I wish he’d use a hundred pound torpedo,</div>
<div class="i1">And make the people mount in air, as we do.</div>
<div class="i1">There go the rocks? “Click, click?” A moment more</div>
<div class="i1">And I am free, that never was before!</div>
<div class="i1">Yes. “Free among the dead,” though some, I heard,</div>
<div class="i1">Were betting “ten to five upon the bird.”</div>
<div class="i1">But can their jargon from the land of death</div>
<div class="i1">Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?</div>
<div class="i1">Or will my ghost be glad, when I am gone,</div>
<div class="i1">That I was “freely backed at two to one?”</div>
<div class="i2">Well, come what will, “This Rock,” at least, shall make</div>
<div class="i1">For life one flutter (“Lady of the Lake”).</div>
<div class="i1">Suppose I fly slap at him, and suppose</div>
<div class="i1">I make him think I mean “to have his nose.”</div>
<div class="i1">Perhaps he’d miss me, but perhaps he wouldn’t;</div>
<div class="i1">And then, how very awkward if he shouldn’t;</div>
<div class="i1">He’d be quite sure to hit me if I crawled;</div>
<div class="i1">I think I’ll try what Juvenal has called</div>
<div class="i1">“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Excelsæ turris tabulata</i>.” Bless it!</div>
<div class="i1">I fear the story goes on, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unde altior esset</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>Casus</i>,” <span class="decoration"><abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></span>,
 ending with a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ruinæ</i>.</div>
<div class="i1">It’s quite enough to make one “shed the briny.”</div>
<div class="i2">Would that like Milton’s demons I could <a href="#ch7">climb</a></div>
<div class="i1">“Part on the earth, and part in air sublime!”</div>
<div class="i1">He’d not know which to fire at, and the puzzle</div>
<div class="i1">Might make him put his shoulder to the muzzle.</div>
<div class="i2">By Jove, I have it! Plan untried by “Rocks,”</div>
<div class="i1">I’ll light (like Bryant’s matches) on the box!</div>
<div class="i1">The line “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In medio tutissimus ibis</i>,”</div>
<div class="i1">Perhaps as truthful of the <em>Pigeon</em> tribe is.</div>
<div class="i1">He might not like to shoot me till I stir;</div>
<div class="i1">“And thus far will I trust thee, gentle sir,”</div>
<div class="i1">I’ll sit on top, and try how long I <em>can</em> sit,</div>
<div class="i1">Time’s precious! “Ready? Pull!” Here goes; I’ll chance it!</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis done&mdash;’tis done! Down swept the leaden trail;</div>
<div class="i1">And must have killed me had I had a tail;</div>
<div class="i1">Behind the trap there was “such scanty room,</div>
<div class="i1">It missed my (absent) <em>helm</em> but razed a plume.”</div>
<div class="i1">Even as it was, so closely came each pellet</div>
<div class="i1">That as it passed I could distinctly smell it.</div>
<div class="i1">Thanks, courteous trap, for rescue in the nick;</div>
<div class="i1">But what a silly man to fire so quick.</div>
<div class="i2">So far so good, but doubtless he has reckoned</div>
<div class="i1">On “dropping me superbly with his second”</div>
<div class="i1">(This sporting euphemism consoles the worst shots</div>
<div class="i1">For missing quite absurdly with their first shots).</div>
<div class="i1">But I won’t budge an inch, and, if he tries,</div>
<div class="i1">He’ll find it hard to <em>drop</em> me till I rise.</div>
<div class="i1">He hesitates, uncertain which to let off,</div>
<div class="i1">The gun or me; perhaps I still may get off.</div>
<div class="i1">But no! the gentle audience sees his doubt,</div>
<div class="i1">And playfully resolves to help him out;</div>
<div class="i1">And fifty throats exclaim, with laughter splitting,</div>
<div class="i1">“Wire in, my boy, and shoot the beggar sitting!”</div>
<div class="i1">Will he “forego his vantage” and retire?</div>
<div class="i1">Ah, no! he quietly proceeds to “wire.”</div>
<div class="i1">The gun is raised! A flash! And so I die&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">No, missed me clean, with none to wipe his eye!</div>
<div class="i1">Swift to the clouds I wing my way with joy,</div>
<div class="i1">While peals of scornful laughter greet “My boy.”</div>
<div class="i1">Quite so! <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Væ victis!</i> They will spare a brute,</div>
<div class="i1">If they can find a human substitute;</div>

<p>“Cato,” a tragedy by Mr. Joseph Addison, was produced

is now well nigh forgotten, but the following soliloquy
was generally inserted in the school books of the last

<p class="p2 center larger">ON THE IMMORTALITY OF
THE SOUL.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">It must be so&mdash;Plato thou reason’st well&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Else why this pleasing hope, this fond desire,</div>
<div class="i1">This longing after immortality?</div>
<div class="i1">Or whence this secret dread, and inward horror,</div>
<div class="i1">Of falling into nought? Why shrinks the soul</div>
<div class="i1">Back on herself, and startles at destruction?</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis the Divinity that stirs within us;</div>

<div class="i1">Through what new scenes and changes must we pass!</div>
<div class="i1">The wide, th’ unbounded prospect lies before me!</div>
<div class="i1">But shadows, clouds, and darkness rest upon it.</div>
<div class="i1">Here will I hold&mdash;If there’s a Power above us</div>
<div class="i1">(And that there is, all nature cries aloud</div>
<div class="i1">Through all her works), he must delight in virtue;</div>
<div class="i1">And that which he delights in must be happy.</div>

<div class="i1">The soul, secur’d in her existence, smiles</div>
<div class="i1">At the drawn dagger, and defies its point:</div>
<div class="i1">The stars shall fade away, the sun himself</div>
<div class="i1">Grow dim with age, and Nature sink in years;</div>
<div class="i1">But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth,</div>

illustration by Robert Seymour. It dealt with William <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>
and his Ministers, and has no present interest whatever.</p>

<p>An imitation of Addison’s prose writings may be found in
<cite>Posthumous Parodies</cite> (London, 1814), it is entitled “A

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">Ode to the Fashions.</span></div>
<div class="i1">When Fancy, heavenly maid, was young,</div>
<div class="i1">And roved the hills and dales among,</div>
<div class="i1">The Fashions, to produce a swell,</div>
<div class="i1">Would throng around her magic cell,</div>
<div class="i1">Exulting, strutting, almost fainting,</div>
<div class="i1">Possessed beyond e’en Planché’s painting,</div>
<div class="i1">By turns they showed creative mind</div>
<div class="i1">In costumes curiously designed,</div>
<div class="i1">When all at once, they all desired,</div>
<div class="i1">Each goddess much to be admired.</div>
<div class="i1">They from imagination caught,</div>
<div class="i1">The wondrous power of Fancy’s thought.</div>
<div class="i1">And by that aid sought to impart</div>
<div class="i1">The lessons of her graceful art,</div>
<div class="i1">And each&mdash;for Fashions rule the hour&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Would prove its own delusive power.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">First <em>Ancient Briton</em> sought to try</div>
<div class="i1">His hand upon the tailoring trade,</div>
<div class="i1">And back recoiled&mdash;pray don’t ask why&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">E’en at the fright himself had made.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A Templar next with eyes on fire,</div>
<div class="i1">Looked through a helmet made of chain,</div>
<div class="i1">And Fancy cried she’d ne’er desire,</div>
<div class="i1">To see such head-dress worn again.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then came the elongated toe</div>
<div class="i1">And hose that made the legs look taper,</div>
<div class="i1">With movement that of course was slow,</div>
<div class="i1">The wearer couldn’t cut a caper.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But thou, oh hoop, with ruffles grand,</div>
<div class="i1">What was thy extended measure,</div>
<div class="i1">In which Queen Bess could take her pleasure,</div>
<div class="i1">And bade her courtiers keep their distance all?</div>
<div class="i1">She scarcely could her train prolong;</div>
<div class="i1">It must have awkward been when at a ball,</div>
<div class="i1">Especially if there had been a throng.</div>
<div class="i1">And when her sweetest dress she chose,</div>
<div class="i1">Soft voices from soft men bepraised her clothes,</div>
<div class="i1">And she enchanted, smiled, and waved her bright red hair.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And long this Fashion reigned, till with a frown,</div>
<div class="i1">The Puritan uprose;</div>
<div class="i1">He raised his sword, and thundered at the gown,</div>
<div class="i1">And, with determined look,</div>
<div class="i1">Ruffling the ruffles, took</div>
<div class="i1">A sight; and as he did so said,</div>
<div class="i1">That such a bauble from the scene must go.</div>
<div class="i1">And ever and anon he beat</div>
<div class="i1">The “Devil’s Tattoo” with his feet,</div>
<div class="i1">With scarcely any pause whate’er between.</div>
<div class="i1">Dejected Cavaliers tried</div>
<div class="i1">Their deep vexation all to hide,</div>
<div class="i1">As thus the Puritan maintained his mien,</div>
<div class="i1">And spoke as though a cold affected his round head.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then came the Restoration with nought fixed,</div>
<div class="i1">Sad proof of what had been the state</div>
<div class="i1">Of parties&mdash;for then all kinds were mixed&mdash;</div>
<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a><span class="pageno">316</span>
<div class="i1">And now they courted lace to show their Roundhead hate.</div>
<div class="i1">With curls turned up beneath the tile,</div>
<div class="i1">The wig full bottomed showed its style,</div>
<div class="i1">The wearing which, when in the street,</div>
<div class="i1">Could surely not have been a treat;</div>
<div class="i1">The style passed through three reigns, dating from Anne,</div>
<div class="i3">This Brunswick fashion all around,</div>
<div class="i3">In circles quite genteel, was found;</div>
<div class="i1">Through promenades the hideous head-dress ran,</div>
<div class="i1">And e’en the country spots, the histories say,</div>
<div class="i1">Found the strange taste diffusing,</div>
<div class="i1">Love of wigs ’twas  quite amusing;</div>
<div class="i1">At length the costume died away.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And now how altered is the Fashion’s tone!</div>
<div class="i1">When silks and satin of most brilliant hue</div>
<div class="i1">Their show across each shoulder flung,</div>
<div class="i1">Their flounces gemmed with ribbons, too,</div>
<div class="i1">Had <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a distingué</i> air when seen upon the young,</div>
<div class="i1">A charm that’s in Belgravia well-known,</div>
<div class="i1">In <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nez retroussé</i>, or in beauty’s queen,</div>
<div class="i1">So that e’en beardless boys are seen</div>
<div class="i1">Looking quite sheepish or quite green,</div>
<div class="i1">Till exercise gives them a leer,</div>
<div class="i1">As love leaps up where Fashion doth appear.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Last came crinoline into the trial;</div>
<div class="i1">She, with mighty hoops advancing,</div>
<div class="i1">First with flowing flounces it was dressed,</div>
<div class="i1">But soon she saw, for beauty quick doth eye all,</div>
<div class="i1">That something yet should her fair form invest.</div>
<div class="i1">They would have thought, who saw the train,</div>
<div class="i1">That it could scarcely be on English maids,</div>
<div class="i1">Here, where decorum oft upraids</div>
<div class="i1">Our Mabille mode of dancing,</div>
<div class="i1">And modesty looks sheepish at such things.</div>
<div class="i1">Love raised up mirth on this fantastic round,</div>
<div class="i1">Which looked like a balloon just coming to the ground,</div>
<div class="i1">’Neath which the ankles made display,</div>
<div class="i1">Which, with Balmoral boots, looked very gay</div>
<div class="i1">As military heels displayed their rings.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Oh, Fashion, most fantastic maid!</div>
<div class="i1">Friend of pleasure, frailty’s aid;</div>
<div class="i1">Why, goddess, it can’t be denied</div>
<div class="i1">That thou dost many a blemish hide.</div>
<div class="i1">But where is now the simple art</div>
<div class="i1">That did in ages past impart</div>
<div class="i1">A grace, which scarcely now is thine,</div>
<div class="i1">Unto the human form divine?</div>
<div class="i1">Arise, as in the elder time,</div>
<div class="i1">When simple grace was quite sublime:</div>
<div class="i1">The triumph of that graceful age,</div>
<div class="i1">Display once more upon the page</div>
<div class="i1">Of Fashion’s book, <cite>Le Follet</cite> named,</div>
<div class="i1">Through which new fashions are proclaimed.</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis said, and I believe the tale,</div>
<div class="i1">The simplest dress did more prevail,</div>
<div class="i1">Had much more charm folks to engage</div>
<div class="i1">Than the strange guise of modern age!</div>
<div class="i1">Then bid your vain displays to cease,</div>
<div class="i1">Give the simplicity of Greece,</div>
<div class="i1">Return us to that simple boast,</div>
<div class="i1">That beauty unadorned’s adorned the most.</div>

<p>The following parody was satirically attributed to William
Cobbett, M.P., by the Editor of <cite>The Satirist</cite>, in which
paper it appeared in August, 1810. The whole of it is
bitterly personal and offensive, but it must be remembered
that Cobbett himself never spared the feelings or characters
of his adversaries:&mdash;</p>

<p>This is also given in full in <cite>The Satirist</cite> for May 12, 1812,
where it is attributed to Mr. J. Taylor, who had then
recently published a volume of poems. Neither of the
above is of sufficient interest to reprint in full, the first,
indeed, is too coarse to please modern readers.</p>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">Written in the Temple Gardens.</span></div>
<div class="i1">The gard’ner rings the bell at close of day,</div>
<div class="i2">The motley crowd wind slowly home to tea;</div>
<div class="i1">Soft on the Thames the daylight fades away,</div>
<div class="i2">And leaves the walks to darkness and to me,</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now shine the glimmering gas-lights on the sight,</div>
<div class="i2">The warders now the outer portals lock,</div>
<div class="i1">And deepest stillness marks th’ approach of night,</div>
<div class="i2">Save when the watchman calls “Past ten o’clock.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Save, also, when from yonder antique tower<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_143"

<div class="i2">With solemn sound, the bell strikes on the ear,</div>
<div class="i1">And wand’ring damsels, as they hear the hour,</div>
<div class="i2">Trip through the gloomy courts with haste and fear.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">In those high rooms, where clients ne’er intrude,</div>
<div class="i2">And here and there a light doth dimly peep,</div>
<div class="i1">Each in his lonely set of chambers mewed,</div>
<div class="i2">The briefless crowd their nightly vigils keep.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The grave attorney, knocking frequently,</div>
<div class="i2">The tittering clerk, who hastens to the door,</div>
<div class="i1">The bulky brief, and corresponding fee,</div>
<div class="i2">Are things unknown to all that lofty floor.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Small comfort theirs when each dull day is o’er:</div>
<div class="i2">No gentle wife their joys and griefs to share,</div>
<div class="i1">No quiet homeward walk at half-past four</div>
<div class="i2">To some snug tenement near Russell Square.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Oft have they read each prosing term report,</div>
<div class="i2">Dull treatises, and statutes not a few;</div>
<div class="i1">How many a vacant day they’ve pass’d in court;</div>
<div class="i2">How many a barren circuit travell’d through.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Yet let not judges mock their useless toil,</div>
<div class="i2">And joke at sapient faces no one knows,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor ask, with careless and contemptuous smile,</div>
<div class="i2">If no one moves in all the long back rows?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Vain is the coif, the ermined robe, the strife</div>
<div class="i2">Of courts, and vain is all success e’er gave;</div>
<div class="i1">Say, can the judge, whose word gives death or life,</div>
<div class="i2">Reprieve himself when summon’d to the grave?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Nor you, ye leaders, view them with ill-will</div>
<div class="i2">If no one sees their speeches in <cite>The Times</cite>,</div>
<div class="i1">Where long-drawn columns oft proclaim your skill</div>
<div class="i2">To blacken innocence, and palliate crimes.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Can legal lore or animated speech</div>
<div class="i2">Avert that sentence which awaits on all?</div>

<div class="i2">Men deeply versed in all the quirks of laws,</div>
<div class="i1">Who could with cases right and wrong confound,</div>
<div class="i2">And common sense upset, by splitting straws.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But, ah! to them no clerk his golden page,</div>
<div class="i2">Rich with retaining-fees, did e’er unroll;</div>
<div class="i1">Chill negligence repress’d their legal rage,</div>
<div class="i2">And from the quibbling current of the soul,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Full many a barrister who well could plead,</div>
<div class="i2">Those dark and unfrequented chambers bear;</div>

<div class="i2">And waste his counts upon the desert air!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Some Follett, whom no client e’er would trust,</div>

<div class="i1">In den obscure, some Denman there may rust;</div>
<div class="i2">Some Campbell, with no peeress for his wife.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The wits of wond’ring juries to beguile,</div>
<div class="i2">The wrongs of injured clients to redress:</div>
<div class="i1">To gain or lose their verdict with a smile,</div>
<div class="i2">And read their speeches in the daily press,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Their lot forbad&mdash;nor was it theirs, d’ye see?</div>
<div class="i2">The wretched in the toils of law to lure;</div>
<div class="i1">To prostitute their conscience for a fee,</div>
<div class="i2">And shut the gates of justice on the poor.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">To try mean tricks to win a paltry cause,</div>
<div class="i2">With threadbare jests to catch the laugh of fools,</div>
<div class="i1">Or puff in court before all human laws,</div>
<div class="i2">The lofty wisdom of the last New Rules.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Not one rule <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi</i>, even “to compute,”</div>
<div class="i2">Their gentle voices e’er were heard to pray,</div>
<div class="i1">Calm and sequester’d, motionless and mute,</div>
<div class="i2">In the remote back seats they pass’d each day.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Yet e’en their names are sometimes seen in print,</div>
<div class="i2">For Frail memorials on the outer doors</div>
<div class="i1">Disclose, in letters large, and dingy tints,</div>
<div class="i2">The unknown tenants of the upper floors.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Door-posts supply the place of Term Reports,</div>
<div class="i2">And splendid plates around the painter sticks,</div>
<div class="i1">To show that he, who never moved the courts,</div>
<div class="i2">Has moved from number two to number six.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For who, to cold neglect a luckless prey</div>
<div class="i2">His unfrequented attic e’er resign’d,</div>
<div class="i1">E’er moved with better hopes across the way</div>
<div class="i2">And did not leave a spruce tin-plate behind?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Strong is the love of fame in nobler minds,</div>
<div class="i2">And he whose bold aspiring fate doth crush,</div>
<div class="i1">Receives some consolation when he finds</div>
<div class="i2">His name recorded by the painter’s brush.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For thee who, mindful of each briefless wight,</div>
<div class="i2">Dost in these motley rhymes their tale relate.</div>
<div class="i1">If, musing in this lonely attic flight</div>
<div class="i2">Some youthful students should inquire thy fate,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Haply some usher of the court may say&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">“At noon I’ve mark’d him oft, ’tween nine and ten</div>
<div class="i1">Striding, with hasty step, the Strand away,</div>
<div class="i2">At four o’clock to saunter back again.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">There in the Bail Court, where yon quaint old judge,</div>
<div class="i2">Doth twist his nose, and wreath his wig awry,</div>
<div class="i1">Listless for hours he’d sit, and never budge,</div>
<div class="i2">And pore upon a book-the Lord knows why.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Oft would he bid me fetch him some report,</div>
<div class="i2">And turn from case to case with look forlorn,</div>
<div class="i1">Then, bustling, would he run from court to court,</div>
<div class="i2">As if some rule of his were coming on.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">One morn I miss’d that figure lean and lank,</div>
<div class="i2">And that pale face, so often mark’d by me,</div>
<div class="i1">Another case&mdash;nor yet was he in Banc,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor at th’ Exchequer, nor the Pleas was he.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The next day, as at morn I chanced to see</div>
<div class="i2">Death’s peremptory paper in <cite>The Times</cite>,</div>
<div class="i1">I read his name, which there stood number three,</div>
<div class="i2">And there I also read these doleful rhymes,”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><span class="sc">Epitaph</span></div>
<div class="i1">“Here rests a youth lamented but by few;</div>
<div class="i2">A barrister, to fame and courts unknown.</div>
<div class="i1">Brief was his life&mdash;yet was it briefless, too,</div>
<div class="i2">For no attorney mark’d him for his own.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Deep and correct his knowledge of the laws,</div>
<div class="i2">No judge a rule of his could e’er refuse;</div>
<div class="i1">He never lost a client or a cause,</div>
<div class="i2">Because, forsooth, he ne’er had one to lose.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“E’en as he lived unknown&mdash;unknown he dies,</div>
<div class="i2">Calm be his rest, from hopeless struggle free,</div>
<div class="i1">’Till that dread court, from which no error lies,</div>
<div class="i2">Shall final judgment pass on him and thee.”</div>

<p>The following imitation of the “Elegy” appeared in
<cite>The Volunteer Record and Shooting News</cite> (London, 33, King
William Street, E.C.), August 11, 1888. It was written

meetings on Wimbledon Common. The first meeting was
held there in July, 1860.</p>

Garland</cite>” which has recently been re-issued by Messrs.
Hamilton, Adams &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, London.</p>

<p>The parody was written by Colin Maclaurin, Esquire,
advocate, and was first privately printed at Edinburgh in
1814. It relates the cares and anxieties incident to the legal
profession:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">The bell now tolls, soon after dawn of day,</div>
<div class="i2">The lawyer herd wind slowly up the street,</div>
<div class="i1">The macer court-ward plods his weary way,</div>
<div class="i2">Anxious, in haste, each learned judge to meet.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And soon the bustling scene delights the sight,</div>
<div class="i2">In yonder gorgeous and stupendous hall,</div>
<div class="i1">While eager macers call, with all their might,</div>
<div class="i2">The busy lawyers from each judge’s roll.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">E’re long, from yonder velvet-mantled chair,</div>
<div class="i2">The angry judge does to the bar complain,</div>
<div class="i1">Of counsel who, by way and means unfair,</div>
<div class="i2">Molest his potent and judicial reign.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Beneath yon fretted roof that rafters shade,</div>
<div class="i2">Whare lie huge deeds in many mouldering heads,</div>
<div class="i1">Each, in its narrow cell, far too long laid,</div>
<div class="i2">Many a dusty process often sleeps.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The dreadful call of macer, like a horn,</div>
<div class="i2">The agent, tottering from some humble shed,</div>
<div class="i1">The lawyer’s claron, like the cock’s, at morn,</div>
<div class="i2">No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For them no more the agent’s lamp shall burn,</div>
<div class="i2">Or busy clerk oft’ ply his evening care,</div>
<div class="i1">No counsel run to hail their quick return,</div>
<div class="i2">Or long their client’s envied fees to share.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Oft’ did the harvest to their wishes yield,</div>
<div class="i2">And knotty points their stubborn souls oft’ broke.</div>
<div class="i1">How keenly did they, then, their clients shield!</div>
<div class="i2">How bow’d the laws beneath their sturdy stroke.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Let not derision mock their useful toils,</div>
<div class="i2">Forensic broils, and origin obscure,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor judges hear, with a disdainful smile,</div>
<div class="i2">The short and simple causes of the poor.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The boast of sov’reignty, the rod of power,</div>
<div class="i2">And all the sway that judges ever have,</div>
<div class="i1">Await alike the inevitable hour</div>
<div class="i2">When all must yield to some designing knave.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Nor you, ye vain, impute to such the fault,</div>
<div class="i2">If mem’ry o’er his deeds no trophies raise,</div>
<div class="i1">Where, thro’ the long drawn hall and fretted vault,</div>
<div class="i2">The well-fee’d lawyer swells his note of praise.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">For thee, who mindful of each agent’s deeds,</div>
<div class="i2">Dost in these lines their artful ways relate</div>
<div class="i1">If chance, or lonely contemplation leads</div>
<div class="i2">Some kindred spirit to enquire thy fate;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Haply some hoary headed sage may say,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Oft’ have we seen him, at the peep of dawn,</div>
<div class="i1">Brushing, with hasty steps, the dews away,</div>
<div class="i2">To meet the judges, at the court in town.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">One morn I miss’d him in th’ accustomed hall,</div>
<div class="i2">Upon the boards, and near his favourite seat;</div>
<div class="i1">Another came, and answered to the roll:</div>
<div class="i2">Nor at the bar nor in the court he sate.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The next, with dirges due, in sad array,</div>
<div class="i2">Slow through the church-way path we saw him borne:</div>
<div class="i1">Approach and read, for thou canst read the lay</div>
<div class="i2">Grav’d on his stone, beneath yon aged thorn.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><span class="sc">Epitaph.</span></div>
<div class="i1">Here rests his head upon the lap of earth,</div>
<div class="i2">A youth to Business and to Law well known;</div>
<div class="i1">Fair Science frown’d not on his humble birth,</div>
<div class="i2">And Litigation marked him as her own.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,</div>
<div class="i2">Heaven did a recompense as largely send:</div>
<div class="i1">He gave to Mis’ry (all he had), a tear;</div>
<div class="i2">He gain’d from Heav’n (’twas  all he wished), a friend.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">No further seek his merits to disclose,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor draw his frailties from their dread abode;</div>
<div class="i1">(There they, like many a lawyer’s, now repose)</div>
<div class="i2">The bosom of his Father and his God.</div>

<div class="i1">The swain now is silent&mdash;the stranger complies,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">His coat now he slowly unclos’d!</div>
<div class="i1">Good Gods! what a sight met poor Roger’s gray eyes,</div>
<div class="i1">What words can express his dismay and surprise,</div>

<div class="i1">Four times in each year, when in judgment profound</div>
<div class="i2">The Quorum all doze on the Bench,</div>

<div class="i1">With a friend, in the sum of at least forty pound,</div>
<div class="i2">To provide for the child and the wench.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The Church-wardens sit round the treat they don’t pay,</div>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Beautiful Snow.</span></p>

<p>A correspondent in Chicago writes in reference to this
poem (see <a href="#Page_268">page 268</a>) “there seems little doubt but that it
was written by Mr. James M. Watson. Mr. Bryant in
his <cite>Library of Poetry and Song</cite>, and Mr. Coates in his
<cite>Fire-side Cyclopedia</cite> both name him as the author. The
last verse, however, which you quote is not a part of the
original poem, but added later, and by another hand.
Mr. W. F. Fox, of this city, wrote an additional verse to
supply the idea of final hope of forgiveness and happiness.
It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">How strange it should be that the beautiful snow</div>
<div class="i1">Should robe with its brightness this world in its woe!</div>
<div class="i1">Yet the soft crystals so tenderly falling,</div>
<div class="i1">Speak to my heart as if angels were calling,</div>
<div class="i1">Lovingly, earnestly, bidding me come,</div>
<div class="i1">Offering this soul of mine rest and a home;</div>
<div class="i1">Away in the mansion of glory above,</div>
<div class="i1">I’ll plead for admission through pardoning love,</div>
<div class="i1">There, robed in that mantle God’s grace can bestow,</div>
<div class="i1">I’ll rival the whiteness of beautiful snow.</div>

<p>The authorship of this poem has been very much discussed
over here in the United States. The following
verses, which went the rounds a few years ago, were
keenly enjoyed by the reading world”:&mdash;</p>

<cite>The Gallant Three Hundred.</cite></div>
<div class="i1">Three hundred brave warriors with pistols and rifles,</div>
<div class="i1">Who will not be daunted by dangers or trifles</div>
<div class="i1">Have taken an oath and are ready to go,</div>
<div class="i1">On a hunt for the author of “Beautiful Snow.”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Too long has he lived on this suffering earth,</div>
<div class="i1">Too long has he haunted the family hearth,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">If they find him&mdash;and surely we hope that they will&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">They will finish him up, for they’ll hunt him to kill;</div>
<div class="i1">The gallant Three Hundred will follow the chase,</div>
<div class="i1">Till they come within sight of his back or his face.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then fearlessly charging the terrible foe,</div>
<div class="i1">They will pepper the author of “Beautiful Snow,”</div>
<div class="i1">So let the brave heroes in battle array,</div>
<div class="i1">Dash off to “the front” well equipped for the fray.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Accomplish their purpose they can and they must,</div>
<div class="i1">For their cause is the people’s, their warfare is just,</div>
<div class="i1">And when their good work is effectively done,</div>
<div class="i1">When the battle is fought and the victory won,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">They’ll return with their banner star spangled and bright,</div>
<div class="i1">And high on their flagstaff plainly in sight</div>
<div class="i1">Will dangle what all must feel happy to know,</div>
<div class="i1">Is the scalp of the author of “Beautiful Snow.”</div>

<div class="chapter box">
<p>“There is no talent so universally entertaining as that of mimickry, even when it is
confined to the lively imitation of the air, manner, and external deportment of ordinary
individuals.</p>

<p>It rises in interest, however, and in dignity, when it succeeds in expressing, not
merely the visible and external characteristics of its objects, but those also of their taste,
their genius and temper. A vulgar mimic repeats a man’s known stories, with an exact
imitation of his voice and gestures; but he is an artist of a far higher description, who can
make stories or reasonings in his manner, and represent the features and movements of his
mind, as well as the accidents of his body. The same distinction applies to the mimickry,
if it may be so called, of an author’s style and manner of writing.</p>

<p>It is another matter, however, to be able to borrow the diction and manner of a
celebrated writer to express sentiments like his own&mdash;to write as he would have written
on the subject proposed to his imitator&mdash;to think his thoughts in short, as well as to use
his words&mdash;and to make the revival of his style appear a natural consequence of the
strong conception of his peculiar ideas. To do this in all the perfection of which it is
capable, requires talents, perhaps, not inferior to those of the original on whom they are
employed&mdash;together with a faculty of observation, and a dexterity of application, which
that original might not always possess; and should not only afford nearly as great
pleasure to the reader, as a piece of composition,&mdash;but may teach him some lessons, or
open up to him some views, which could not have been otherwise disclosed.</p>

<p>The exact imitation of a good thing, it must be admitted, promises fair to be a pretty
good thing in itself; but if the resemblance be very striking, it commonly has the
additional advantage of letting us more completely into the secret of the original
author, and enabling us to understand far more clearly in what the peculiarity of his
manner consists, than most of us should ever have done without this assistance. The
resemblance, it is obvious, can only be rendered striking by exaggerating a little, and
bringing more conspicuously forward, all that is peculiar and characteristic in the
model.”</p>

 Sir Francis Burdett (father of the present Lady Burdett Coutts) was
 Radical M.P. for Westminster. Perhaps the greatest event of his life
 was his committal to the Tower under the Speaker’s warrant for a
 libellous letter published in <cite>Cobbett’s Political
 Register</cite> of March 24, 1810, in which he questioned the power
 of the House of Commons to imprison delinquents. He at first resisted
 the execution of the warrant, and being a favourite with the mob, a
 street contest ensued between the military and the people, in which
 some lives were lost.</p>

 <span class="decoration">Ranelagh</span> was a famous place of public
 entertainment erected about 1740, at Chelsea, close to the banks of
 the Thames, on the site of the gardens of a villa which had formerly
 belonged to Viscount Ranelagh. The great hall, known as the Rotunda,
 was opened on April 5, 1742, it was 185 feet in diameter. This was
 designed by Mr. Lacy, formerly one of the managers of Drury Lane
 Theatre. Bonnell Thornton’s Burlesque Ode on <abbr
 title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cecilias’ Day, set to music by Dr. Burney,
 was performed at Ranelagh to a crowded audience. The last grand <i
 lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> held at Ranelagh was the
 installation ball of the Knights of the Bath, in 1802. The site now
 forms part of Chelsea Hospital Gardens, between Church Row and the
 river, to the east of the Hospital, but no trace now remains of
 Ranelagh. A very good description of the Gardens and Buildings will
 be found in Thomas Faulkner’s <cite>Description of Chelsea</cite>.

 This and subsequent allusions to the Valentino, the <i lang="fr"

 would fix the authorship of this ballad at a date anterior to the

 described as singing now obsolete melodies of Ethiopian origin. In

 have been the “Ratcatcher’s Daughter,” or possibly, “Villikins.” The

 At a meeting of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers

 Kinney and Walker were two leaders of the “fillibusters”
who went “piratifying to extend the area of
freedom” in Central America in 1855-60. Walker was
shot, as he richly deserved, by the Honduras folks in 1860.
He lived in San Francisco, 1850-55, and the southerners
there (they are quite numerous and are called the
“chivs,” from chivalry), are still noticeably inclined to
think his views were not far wrong.</p>

<p>This book was written in a period when many words had not become
standardized in their spelling. Words may have multiple spelling
variations or inconsistent hyphenation in the text. These have been
left unchanged unless indicated below.</p>

<p>Notes associated with stanza numbers in Gray's Elegy follow the poem.
All other footnotes were renumbered sequentially and were moved to
the end of the book. Obvious printing errors, such as backwards,
upside down, unprinted or partially printed letters, were corrected.
Final stops missing at the end of sentences and abbreviations were
added. Duplicate letters at line endings or page breaks were
removed.</p>

<p>There are multiple anchors to Footnotes <a

belong.</p>

<p>Unprinted diacriticals were added to words in languages other than

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
